Plotting

density-of-states

(DOS),

photoelectron

spectrum (PES), and COHP (10)
TDOS, PDOS and OPDOS are most frequently studied DOS types, their definitions and
plotting methods in Multiwfn will be described in Sections 3.12.1, 3.12.2 and 3.12.3. The local DOS
(LDOS) is a special kind of DOS, which will be introduced in Section 3.12.4. Since the TDOS is
closely related to photoelectron spectra (PES), this module is also capable of plotting PES, which
will be introduced in Section 3.12.5. In Section 3.12.6, crystal overlap Hamilton populations (COHP)
will be introduced, which is closely related to OPDOS.

3.12.1 Theory
Density-of-states (DOS) is an important concept of solid physics, which represents the number
of states in unit energy interval, since energy levels are contiguous, so DOS can be plotted as curve
map. In isolated system (such as molecule), the energy levels are discrete, the concept of DOS is
questionable and some people argued that DOS is completely valueless in this situation. However,
if the discrete energy levels are broadened to curve artificially, DOS graph can be used as a valuable
tool for analyzing the nature of electron structure.
The total DOS (TDOS) of isolated systems can be written as

TDOS( E ) =  ( E −  i )
i

where {} is eigenvalue set of single-particle Hamilton,  is Dirac delta function. If  is replaced by
broadening function F(x), such as Gaussian, Lorentzian and pseudo-Voigt function, we get
broadened TDOS.
The normalized Gaussian function is defined as

G ( x) =

1
c 2

e

−

x2
2c 2

where c =

FWHM
2 2 ln 2

FWHM is acronym of “full width at half maximum”, it is an adjustable parameter in Multiwfn.
The larger the FWHM, the smoother the TDOS graph, but the more the detailed information about
energy level distribution is lost.
The normalized Lorentzian function is defined as

L( x ) =

FWHM
1
2
2
x + 0.25  FWHM 2

Pseudo-Voigt function is weighted linear combination of Gaussian function and Lorentzian
function:

P( x ) = wGaussG ( x ) + (1 − wGauss ) L( x )
Obviously, if G(x) and L(x) are normalized, normalization condition for P(x) always holds
regardless of the select of wGauss.
The curve map of broadened partial DOS (PDOS) and overlap DOS (OPDOS) are very
valuable for visual study of orbital composition. PDOS of fragment A is defined as

3 Functions

PDOS A ( E ) =  i , A F ( E −  i )
i

where i,A is the composition of fragment A in orbital i. Note that the word "projected DOS" used
in some literatures is essentially equivalent to the partial DOS.
The OPDOS between fragment A and B is defined as

OPDOS A,B ( E ) =  iA,B F ( E −  i )
i

𝑖
where X𝐴,𝐵
is the composition of total cross term between fragment A and B in orbital i. I have

discussed how to calculate  and  in Section 3.10.3.
In Multiwfn, OPDOS can also be calculated between all nearest atoms. In this case, OPDOS is
calculated as

OPDOSnear ( E ) =  niA, Aadj F ( E −  i )
i

A

𝑖
where A loops over all atoms, Aadj denotes the atom in the system closest to A. 𝑛𝐴,𝐴
corresponds
adj

to overlap population between A and Aadj in orbital i.
When one or more fragments are defined by users, Multiwfn will automatically calculate center
of PDOS of every fragment as follows and print it in command-line window when showing DOS
map

 c ,F


=

high

low



E  PDOSF ( E ) d E

high

low

PDOSF ( E ) d E

where low and high are lower and upper limits of current X-axis (energy range), the F denotes the
fragment under consideration. Via this feature, one can easily calculate d-band center, which is
important in studying chemisorption on transition metal surface. See Section 4.10.6 for example.
Illustration of DOS: Ferrocene
Below is a DOS map of a typical molecule ferrocene, Lanl2DZ basis set in combination with
Lanl2 pseudopotential was employed for iron, while 6-31G* was employed for other elements. In
this system the Z-axis is perpendicular to cyclopentadienyl groups.

The graph clearly exhibits orbital characteristics in different energy ranges, each discrete lines
corresponds to a MO. The curves are yielded by applying broadening function to the discrete lines.
The left and right Y-axes correspond to the curves and discrete lines, respectively. Notice that only
relative height rather than absolute height of curves is meaningful. It is obvious that the major
contribution from s, px and py atomic orbitals of carbon (magenta curve) is due to low-lying MOs
rather than frontier MOs. The major composition of MOs around -0.25 a.u. comes from pz orbital
of carbon (blue curve) and iron atom (red curve). Inspection of the green OPDOS curve, which
corresponds to the bonding between carbon pz and iron atom, suggests that carbon pz orbitals are
very important for stabilization of ferrocene, since OPDOS has large positive value in these ranges.
HOMO is almost purely contributed by iron orbitals, however its slight overlap with carbon pz
orbitals is still beneficial to bonding. For all virtual MOs, OPDOS curve is in negative region and
shows antibonding characteristic, this is due to the unfavorable overlapping in orbital phase, as can
been seen from LUMO isosurface.

3.12.2 Input file
.mwfn/.fch/.molden/.gms files can be used as input. You can also use output file of single point
task of Gaussian program as input (pop=full keyword must be specified).
For generality, Multiwfn also supports using plain text file as input file, the format is free, there
is no upper limit of the number of orbitals. The format of the file should be
nmo inp
energy occ [strength] [FWHM]
energy occ [strength] [FWHM]
energy occ [strength] [FWHM]
...

 For orbital 1
 For orbital 2
 For orbital 3

energy occ [strength] [FWHM]
 For orbital nmo
where energy and occ denote orbital energy and occupation number, respectively. nmo is the number
of orbitals recorded in this file. inp is input type, there four cases:




1: Only energies (in a.u.) and occupation numbers will be loaded, while strengths and FWHMs
of all orbitals will be automatically set to 1.0 and 0.25 a.u., respectively
2: The same as 1, but you also have to specify strength and FWHM for each orbital as columns
3 and 4 because in this case they will also be loaded. If the strength of an orbital is set to k,
then the broadened curve from this orbital will be normalized to k rather than 1 (default value)
3: The same as 1, but energy unit is eV.
4: The same as 2, but energy unit is eV.

3.12.3 Options for plotting DOS and basic usage
When you entered the interface of plotting DOS, you will see following options. Notice that
options -1 and 7 only appear when the input file contains basis function information, that is if you
want to draw PDOS and OPDOS graph, you have to use .mwfn/.fch/.molden/.gms file as input.
Also note that in this interface, you can input s to save current status (plotting settings, fragment
definition and orbital information) to a specific file, and you can input l to load status from a specific
file, so that you can quickly replot a map without redoing the settings.
-6 Set shift of energy levels: In this option, orbital energies can be shifted by an inputted value.
If you input H, then the shift will be set to negative of HOMO energy, so that HOMO in the DOS
map corresponds to position of 0.
-5 Customize energy levels, occupations, strengths and FWHMs for specific MOs: By this
option, you can manually set energies, occupations, strengths and FWHMs for specific orbitals. For
example, if you would like only to plot DOS for a few MOs, you can set strengths of the other MOs
to zero (by default, strengths for all MOs are 1.0).
-4 Show all orbital information: Print information of all orbitals on screen.
-3 Export energy levels, strengths, FWHMs to plain text file: Export energy, strength and
FWHM of each orbital to orginfo.txt in current directory, this file complies the format introduced in
last section, so can be directly used as input file.
-2 Define MO fragments for MO-PDOS: The "MO-PDOS" is a special kind of PDOS, which
is used to reveal DOS contributed by different sets of MOs (rather than atoms or basis functions),
the DOS curves and discrete lines corresponding to different sets of MOs are drawn using different
colors. This option is used to define different sets of MOs involved in the "MO-PDOS" plot. See
Section 4.10.5 for example.
-1 Define fragments for PDOS/OPDOS: You can define up to 10 fragments in this option, so
that you can plot PDOS and OPDOS. After you entered this option, the information of present
fragments is shown on screen. You can input x to define fragment x, and input -x to unset fragment
x, or input i,j to exchange the definition of fragment i and j. To leave this interface, input 0 or q. By
option 0, PDOS will be plotted for every fragment defined in this option. OPDOS can be drawn
only when both fragments 1 and 2 have been defined.
It is noteworthy that, when plotting OPDOS, the defined fragment 1 and fragment 2 can share one or more basis
functions, the two fragments can even have the same definition. In this case only cross terms between basis functions
will be calculated, while local terms (characterizing on-site interactions) will be ignored.

0 Draw TDOS/PDOS/OPDOS graph: After selecting this option, TDOS map will be
immediately shown on screen. If any fragment has been defined, TDOS+PDOS will be plotted. If
both fragments 1 and 2 have been defined, TDOS+PDOS+OPDOS will be plotted, however you
can also choose option -0 in this case to only plot TDOS+PDOS.

00 Draw TDOS and OPDOS between nearest atoms: This option is visible if you have not
defined any fragment. After selecting it, TDOS and the OPDOSnear mentioned in Section 3.12.1 will
be plotted together.
1 Select broadening function: Select which broadening function will be used, you can select
Lorentzian, Gaussian or Pseudo-Voigt function. Default is Gaussian.
2 Set energy range and step: This option is used to set the lower limit, upper limit and step
between labels of X-axis.
3 Set full width at half maximum (FWHM): As the title says.
4 Set scale ratio for DOS curve: If this option is set to k, then height of all curves will multiply
k (in full energy range).
5 Set Gaussian-weighting coefficient: This option sets wgauss, which is mentioned in last
section. This option only appears when Pseudo-Voigt function is chosen.
6 Choose orbital spin: This option appears only when the loaded file contains basis function
information and the wavefunction is unrestricted. This option determines which set of orbitals (alpha,
beta, or both alpha and beta) will be taken into account.
7 Set the method for calculating PDOS: Mulliken, SCPA, Hirshfeld and Becke methods are
supported for calculating orbital compositions used in plotting PDOS, via this option you can select
one of them. Hirshfeld and Becke methods are more robust than Mulliken and SCPA methods,
especially for unoccupied MOs, unfortunately they are more expensive, and in this case OPDOS
cannot be plotted (i.e. the fragments can only be defined as a set of atoms). It is very important to
note that when diffuse functions are presented, the PDOS maps plotted based on Mulliken or SCPA
methods will be meaningless! If you diffuse functions cannot be ignored due to special reasons,
Hirshfeld or Becke method have to be employed.
For isolated systems, Mulliken is the default method; while for periodic systems, SCPA is the
default method, because evaluation of overlap matrix for large periodic cell may be very timeconsuming, and SCPA does not need overlap matrix.
8 Switch unit between a.u. and eV: You can switch the unit for X-axis of the DOS map via
this option. eV is more commonly used.
9 Toggle using line height to show orbital degeneracy: If you want to show degeneracy of
orbitals in the DOS map, you can choose this option to enable this effect, then you will be asked to
input threshold of energy difference for determining degeneracy. This feature can be used when
plotting TDOS and MO-PDOS, but cannot be utilized when plotting PDOS.
Once you choose option 0 in the DOS module, Multiwfn starts to calculate data and then DOS
graph pops up. You can see there is a vertical dash line, which highlights position of HOMO level.
Note that some people believe this is Fermi energy, which, however, is an ill-defined concept for
isolated systems, any energy that  EHOMO and < ELUMO may be regarded as "Fermi energy".
After closing the graph, a post-processing menu appears on the screen, it contains many options,
which are self-explanatory and can be used to adjust various plotting parameters. When the
parameters have been changed, you can choose "1 Show graph again" to check the effect. It is
noteworthy that there is an option named “Set scale factor of Y-axis range for OPDOS”, if the value
is set to k and the range of left-axis (for TDOS/PDOS) is set to e.g. [-3.5, 2.0], then the range of
right-axis (for OPDOS) will become [-3.5*k, 2.0*k]. The reason why Multiwfn uses double axis is
because the magnitude of OPDOS is generally much smaller than TDOS and PDOS. You can also

choose to export the DOS map as graphical file in current folder, or export X-Y data set of DOS to
plain text files so that you can reproduce the graph by third-part softwares, such as Origin. By
choosing option 0 you can return to last interface, the quality of DOS graph can be gradually
improved by repeating the adjustments until you are satisfied.
The absolute value of the DOS curves does not have evident practical meaning, only relative
height of the curves at different energy regions is interesting. Hence, after you have properly set
each plotting parameter, you can choose option "13 Toggle showing labels and ticks on Y-axis" in
the post-processing menu to switch its status to "No".
Very detailed examples of plotting TDOS, PDOS and OPDOS are given in Section 4.10.1,
while Section 4.10.3 illustrates how to plot DOS for open-shell systems via Multiwfn in combination
with Origin software to get better effect.

3.12.4 Local DOS
There is a special kind of DOS named local DOS (LDOS), which is also known as spatial DOS.
LDOS curve for a given point r is evaluated as follows:

LDOS(r, E ) = i2 (r) f ( E −  i )
i

It is worth to note that in some first-principles books and literatures, the word "Local DOS" in fact refers to the
PDOS introduced in Section 3.12.1, do not be confused!

To plot LDOS map, choose option "10 Draw local DOS for a point" after you entered main
function 10, you will be prompted to input the coordinate of the point r.
One can also plot LDOS for a set of points placed evenly in a line as color-filled map, the Xaxis correspond to energy, while the Y-axis corresponds to coordinate in the line relative to starting
point. To plot this kind of LDOS map, choose option "11 Draw local DOS along a line", you will be
prompted to input the coordinate of starting point and end point defining the line, as well as the
number of points consisting of the line.
In the DOS module, the options controlling FWHM, energy unit, energy range and scale ratio
affect the resulting LDOS graphs.
Note that fragment definition does not affect the result of LDOS, i.e. the LDOS always
corresponds to total DOS. However, if you want to separate angular moment contribution to LDOS,
you can use subfunction 25 of main function 6 to set coefficient of unwanted GTF in all MOs to
zero, then they will not contribute to LDOS.
An example of plotting LDOS can be found in Section 4.10.2.

3.12.5 Photoelectron spectrum
The plotting of photoelectron spectrum (PES) spectrum based on (generalized) Koopmans'
theorem) is closely related to plotting TDOS. Since PES is a kind of spectrum under frequent studies,
a special interface in the DOS module is provided for easily generating theoretically simulated PES
spectrum.

Theory
The position of the peaks in the PES spectrum reflects the energy difference between various
N-1 states and the original N-electron state. If a system is neutral, the system is usually in vibrational
ground state of neutral electronic state. After ionization of an electrons, the system can be in different
vibrational states of the cationic state. Therefore, the PES has a fine structure, which reflects the
vibration coupling effect. However, in order to simplify the problem, we often ignore the quantum
effect of nuclear motion, and the ionization is assumed to be a vertical process starting from
minimum point of potential energy surface of initial state. At this time, the peak positions in the PES
are equivalent to the vertical ionization energy (VIP) of the electrons of different shells of present
system. Clearly, as long as we optimize the system and then calculate the VIPs, we can simulate the
PES.
The 1st VIP corresponds to the energy needed for ionizing out the electron of outermost shell,
it is usually calculated as E(N-1) - E(N) for a system containing N electrons at minimum point
geometry of potential energy surface of the N-electron state; the E signifies electronic energy. The
VIP corresponding to inner electrons can also be theoretically calculated, but special methods are
needed, such as OVGF, IP-EOM-CC, ADC and so on.
The easiest way to plot PES is based on the Koopmans' theorem, which stated that the
ionization energy of an electron is equal to the negative value of orbital energy of corresponding
shell. Note that this is only an approximate relationship, it fully ignores the electron correlation and
orbital relaxation effect. Under the Koopmans' theorem, the simulated PES simply corresponds to
the TDOS curve broadened by all occupied MOs, however before the broadening the sign of orbital
energies should be reversed (corresponding to "electronic binding energy").
Because of the fact that Koopmans' theorem does not work well for most popular DFT
functionals (except for some special ones, such as QTP17), the negative values of MO energies
deviate from actual VIP evidently, leading to poor PES compared to the experimental one.
Fortunately, there is a so-called generalized Koopmans' theorem, if it is applied to theoretical
simulation of PES, it essentially corresponds to adding a shift value to all electronic binding energies
before PES plotting, the shift value is defined as 1st VIP + E(HOMO). After taking the shift into
account, the first peak of simulated PES will exactly correspond to the 1st VIP, which does not
deviate from the first peak of experimental PES evidently as long as the DFT functionals and basis
set are properly chosen, the geometry has been substantially optimized, and the electronic state to
be computed corresponds to actual ground state.
Usage
The PES plotting interface is embedded in the DOS module as option 12, it allows user to
extremely easily plot PES spectrum based on (generalized) Koopmans' theorem. Any kind of input
files that used for plotting DOS can also be employed for PES plotting purpose.
If you want to plot the PES based on Koopmans' theorem, simply select option 1 after entering
the PES plotting interface. If you want to adopt generalized Koopmans' theorem, you should choose
option 3 to set a shift value before plotting.
There are many parameters and options in the PES plotting interface similar to those in the
DOS plotting interface, such as range and step of X and Y axes, FWHM, if showing discrete lines
and so on, however most parameters are not shared by the two interfaces. Note that only eV unit
and Gaussian broadening function can be employed for PES plotting. If present wavefunction is an
unrestricted open-shell one, the type of orbital spin is not distinguished.

If you want to adjust relative height between the PES curve and the discrete lines corresponding
to various binding energy levels, you can use "11 Set scale ratio for PES curve" to set a scale ratio.
The smaller the ratio, the lower the curve.
If nothing is shown after choosing option 1 to plot the PES spectrum, you should:

Select option "-2 Show all binding energy level information" and then check if values of
binding energies are correct.

Check if range of X-axis has been properly set. To plot PES, there must be at least one
binding energy occurs within the current range of X-axis.
By default, all orbitals have identical strength (1.0) and FWHM (0.2 eV), the latter can be
directly set in the PES interface via option 6. If you want to adjust strength and FWHM for individual
orbitals, you can select "-3 Export occupied MO energies, strengths and FWHMs to plain text file",
then a file PESinfo.txt in a format as described in Section 3.12.2 will be exported to current folder.
You can then manually adjust strengths and FWHMs of certain orbitals in this file, and then use this
file as input file to plot PES, so that the simulated PES could be closer to the experimental one.
The absolute value of the PES curve does not have practical meaning. Hence, after you have
properly set range of Y-axis, you can choose "13 Toggle showing labels and ticks on Y-axis" to
switch its status to "No".
An example of plotting PES is given in Section 4.10.4.
Information needed: For PDOS, OPDOS and local DOS, see Section 3.12.2. For TDOS and
PES spectrum, use .mwfn/.fch/.molden/.gms file, or Gaussian output file with pop=full, or plain text
file in a format as described in Section 3.12.2.

3.12.6 COHP
Theory
In the field of first-principles research, OPDOS is often referred to as crystal orbital overlap
population (COOP), and there is a concept closely related to it named crystal overlap Hamilton
populations (COHP). COHP was originally proposed in J. Phys. Chem., 97, 8617 (1993), and has
wide applications in understanding bonding in solids and material design, see J. Phys. Chem. A, 115,
5461 (2011) and Angew. Chem. Int. Ed., 39, 1560 (2000) for review.
For wavefunctions represented by atomic-centered basis functions, like those produced by
Gaussian and CP2K, COHP can be regarded as simply replacing the overlap matrix in COOP with
Kohn-Sham matrix, so COHP is related to interactions between atoms or fragments from the energy
perspective. Each MO has its COOP and COHP value for the interaction of interest, both positive
COOP and negative COHP suggest that the MO has positive contribution to the interatomic or
interfragment bonding when it is occupied (i.e. bonding state), and the more positive the COOP and
the more negative the COHP, the larger the contribution. In contrast, MO of antibonding state has
negative COOP and positive COHP. COHP may correlate better than COOP with the
interatomic/interfragment bonding strength as it takes energy factor into account. However, I found
COHP curve is somewhat sensitive to the basis set used. So, when comparing COHP between
different cases, exactly the same basis set should be used.
