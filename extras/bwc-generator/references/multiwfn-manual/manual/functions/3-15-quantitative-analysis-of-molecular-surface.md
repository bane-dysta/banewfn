3.15 Quantitative analysis of molecular surface (12)
Quantitative analysis of molecular surface is a powerful tool, it has a lot of practical
applications, such as predicting reactive sites, predicting molecular properties, interpreting
intermolecular weak interaction. The theory and numerical algorithm involved in present module
have been detailedly described in my paper J. Mol. Graph. Model., 38, 314 (2012). In the next two
sections, these two aspects will only be briefly introduced.

3.15.1 Theory
In Multiwfn, in principle, distribution of any real space function on molecular surface (or the
surface defined by isosurface of a certain function) can be quantitatively studied. Electrostatic
potential and average local ionization energy on molecular vdW surface are particularly useful,
therefore they will be discussed detailed in this section. Same kind of quantitative analyses could
also be applied to other real space functions, such as user-defined functions, electron delocalization
range function (EDR) and even Fukui function and dual descriptor.

(1) Electrostatic potential on vdW surface
Molecular electrostatic potential (ESP), V(r), has been widely used for prediction of
nucleophilic and electrophilic sites, as well as molecular recognition mode for a long time, the
theoretical basis is that molecules always tend to approach each other in a complementary manner
of ESP. These analyses of ESP are common performed on molecular van der Waals (vdW) surface.
Although the definition of such a surface is arbitrary, most people prone to take the 0.001 a.u.
isosurface of electron density as vdW surface, since this definition reflects specific electron structure
features of a molecule, such as lone pairs and π electrons, this is also what the definition used in our
analyses.
The analysis of ESP on vdW surface has been further quantified to extract more information.
It is shown that the strength and orientation of weak interaction, including such as hydrogen bonding,
dihydrogen bonding and halogen bonding, can be well predicted and explained by analyzing the
magnitude and positions of minima and maxima on the surface. Politzer and coworkers (J. Mol.
Struct. (THEOCHEM), 307, 55 (1994)) have defined a set of molecular descriptors based on ESP
on vdW surface, which are taken as independent variables of general interaction properties function
(GIPF). GIPF successfully connects distribution of ESP on vdW surface and many condensed phase
properties, including density, boiling point, surface tension, heats of vaporization and sublimation,
LogP, impact sensitivity, diffusion constant, viscosity, solubility, solvation energy and so on. Below
I enumerate and brief these descriptors.
A+ and A− indicate the surface area in which the ESP has positive and negative value,
respectively. Total surface area A is the sum of them.

the index i only loops corresponding points. The S subscript means "molecular surface". The average
of ESP over the entire surface is
N

V S = (1/ N ) V (ri )

where N=N++N− is the total number of surface points.
 is the average deviation over the surface, which is viewed as an indicator of internal charge
separation:

The total ESP variance can be written as the sum of positive and negative parts:

The variance reflects the variability of ESP. The larger the 𝜎+2 and 𝜎−2 , the more tendency that the
molecule interacts with other molecules by positive and negative ESP regions respectively.
Degree of charge balance (also known as balance of charges) is defined as

=

 +2 −2
2 2
( tot
)

When 𝜎+2 equals to 𝜎−2 ,  attains its maximum value of 0.250. The closer the  to 0.250, the more
possible that the molecule can interact to others through positive and negative region with similar
extent.
2
2
The product of 𝜎tot
and  is a very useful quantity too, a large value of 𝜎tot
is an indicative
of a molecule that has relatively strong tendencies to interact with others of its own kind
electrostatically.
In order to quantify molecular polarity, I defined a quantity named molecular polarity index

(MPI), which is closely related to the  index.
N

MPI = (1/ N ) V (ri )  (1/ A)  | V (r) | d S

where S denotes molecular surface. My test for some representative molecules showed that MPI is
a quite reliable index of measuring molecular polarity, the larger the index, the higher the polarity.
If MPI is involved in your research, please cite my paper Carbon, 171, 514 (2021), which is the first
publication introducing the MPI index.
Skewness can be used to measure the asymmetry of distribution of a real space function about
its mean over molecular surface. Positive skewness is calculated as follows

similarly, for calculating negative skewness, only surface points with negative ESP are taken into
account. While for calculating overall skewness, all surface points are used. For each kind of

skewness, the more positive (negative) the value, the stronger the tendency that ESP distributes
toward negative (positive) direction with respect to the average value.
In Multiwfn, above mentioned surface descriptors can be calculated not only on the whole vdW
surface, but also on the subregions corresponding to atoms or user-defined fragments. The detail of
the theory is to be published, and thus not documented here at the moment. In addition, these surface
descriptors can be calculated for any other real space function.

(2) Some practical applications of GIPF descriptors
·Predicting heat of vaporization and heat of sublimation
A practical application of above GIPF descriptors is presented in J. Phys. Chem. A, 110, 1005
(2006). The authors showed that for a series of molecules containing C, H, N and O elements, the
heat of vaporization can be well evaluated as
2
H vap = a A + b  tot
+c

with least-squares fit coefficients a = 2.130, b = 0.930 and c = -17.844. The heat of sublimation can
be predicted as
2
H sub = aA2 + b  tot
+c

with a = 0.000267, b = 1.650087 and c = 2.966078. In above equations the surface area A is in Å2,
2
Hsub is in kcal/mol, 𝜎tot
is in (kcal/mol)2. Note that the coefficients are more or less dependent on
the calculation level used. The author used B3LYP/6-31G* to optimize geometry and B3LYP/6311++G(2df,2p) to calculate ESP.
In Int. J. Quantum Chem., 105, 341 (2005), Politzer et al. proposed another equations for

predicting Hvap and Hsub in standard state, their equations can be used for molecules containing
C, H, O, N, F, Cl, S:
2
H vap = 1.3556 A + 1.1760  tot
− 10.4331
2
H sub = 4.4307  10−4 A2 + 2.0599  tot
− 2.4825

2
The Hvap and Hsub are in kcal/mol, A is in Å2 and 𝜎tot
is in (kcal/mol)2. B3PW91/6-31G** was
employed in their study. The mean absolute error of Hvap and Hsub were found to be 2.0 kcal/mol
and 2.8 kcal/mol, respectively.
·Predicting density of molecular crystal
Another typical application of statistical data of ESP on vdW surface is predicting crystal
density of organic molecules containing C, H, N and O elements. The crystal density is a crucial
property of energetic compounds. In J. Phys. Chem. A, 111, 10874 (2007), it was shown that the

density can be estimated by  = M / Vm, where M is molecular mass and Vm is molecular vdW
volume defined by  = 0.001 a.u. isosurface; for ionic crystal (e.g. ammonium azide), M and Vm
correspond the sum of mass and volume of the cation and anion comprising a formula unit of the
compound. Although the relationship is quite simple, it indeed works well for most neutral species,
but the error is evidently larger for ionic species. In order to improve the prediction accuracy for
neutral ones, in Mol. Phys., 107, 2095 (2009), the authors introduced GIPF descriptors into the
formula:

At B3PW91/6-31G** level, the fitted coefficients are  = 0.9183,  = 0.0028 and  = 0.0443. This
formula has proven to have improved accuracy, because intermolecular electrostatic interaction is
somewhat effectively taken into considered. In a succeeding paper Mol. Phys., 108, 1391 (2010),
the author showed that the crystal density of ionic compounds can be estimated much better than 
= M / Vm if GIPF descriptors are introduced:

(anion) denote the 𝑉S and 𝐴 of the anion. For 30 test cases, the average absolute error is
merely 0.033 g/cm3.
Noticed that above relationships are only appropriate for small organic compounds containing
C, H, N, O elements, the error are significantly larger for other kinds of systems.
·Predicting boiling point
In J. Phys. Chem., 97, 9369 (1993), it is shown that boiling point can be predicted as
2
Tbp = A +   tot
+

where  = 2.736,  = 33.31,  = -72.05 were fitted at HF/STO-5G*//HF/STO-3G* level. This paper
also showed equations for predicting critical temperature, volume and pressure.
·Predicting solvation free energy
In J. Phys. Chem. A, 103, 1853 (1999), the prediction equation for solvation free energy is
presented as (Vmin denotes the ESP value at its global minimum in the whole space):

Gsolv (kJ/mol) = 0.17201Vmin − 2.6412  10−5 (VS, max − VS, min ) 3
−

−

+ 0.051892A− V S + 9704.2 /( A− V S ) + 46.827
·Predicting pKb
In J. Chem. Inf. Model., 60, 1445 (2020), the authors showed that pKb of amino groups can be
nicely estimated by fitting equation, for example, primary amine cases:

p K b = 0.4952  VS,min + 24.5880
where VS,min is in kcal/mol and should be calculated at B97XD/cc-pVDZ level. Prediction accuracy
of this equation is fairly satisfactory, the R2 is as high as 0.9519 with mean absolute error of merely
0.12. Similar fitted equations are also available for secondary amines, tertiary amines and tertiary
amines.
·Predicting other properties
In addition, the equations used to predict heat of fusion, surface tension and crystal/liquid
density can be found in J. Phys. Chem., 99, 12081 (1995), the equations used to predict lattice energy
for ionic crystal containing NH4+, K+ and Na+ are given in J. Phys. Chem. A, 102, 1018 (1998). More
formulae used to predict physical properties of organic molecules based on GIPF descriptors are
summarized in Table 3 of J. Mol. Struct. (THEOCHEM), 425, 107 (1998). GIPF also has many

important uses in study of biochemical systems, see Int. J. Quantum Chem., 85, 676 (2001) for a
review.

(3) Other mapped functions: Average local ionization energy and so on
Average local ionization energy, 𝐼 ,̅ has attracted more and more attentions, see corresponding
part of Section 2.6 for brief introduction. This function has many uses, for example, reproducing
atomic shell structure, measuring electronegativity, quantifying local polarizability and hardness.
However, the most important use maybe the prediction of reactivity according to function value on
vdW surface, 𝐼𝑆̅ . Lower value of 𝐼𝑆̅ indicates that the electron at r is more weakly bounded, therefore
more likely r is the site of electrophilic or radical attack. Many studies have shown that the global
minimum of 𝐼 ̅ on vdW surface exactly locates the experimental reaction site, while relative
magnitude of 𝐼 ̅ at corresponding reaction site in homologues correlates well with relative reactivity.
The interested users are recommended to take a look at J. Mol. Model, 16, 1731 (2010) and Chapter
8 of the book Theoretical Aspects of Chemical Reactivity (2007).
Local electron affinity EAL is a quantity very similar to 𝐼 ,̅ the only difference is that the MOs
under consideration is not all occupied ones, but all unoccupied ones. It was shown that EAL on
molecular surface is useful for analyzing nucleophilic attacking, for detail see J. Mol. Model., 9, 342
(2003).
Quantitative analysis on molecular surface for Fukui function and orbital overlap distance
function D(r) have also been proven to be fairly useful, see Sections 4.12.4 and 4.12.8 for example,
respectively.
About sphericity
At the end of this section, it is worth to mention that Multiwfn automatically prints "sphericity"
of the molecular surface during the calculation irrespective of the choice of mapped function. This
quantity is defined as follows (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphericity for detail)

 1/3 (6V )2/3
S=
A
where A and V are surface area and volume, respectively. Sphericity is essentially the ratio of the
surface area of a sphere with the same volume as the present system to the surface area of the present
system. The closer it to 1.0, the more the surface looks like an ideal sphere. Therefore, for example,
you will find sphericity of vdW surface of benzene is notably smaller than Ar atom, and the
sphericity of  = 0.01 a.u. isosurface is always smaller than that of  = 0.001 a.u. isosurface for any
molecule because the latter is smoother.
Notice that the sphericity calculated in the above way does not work for systems with cavity.
For example, it cannot be used to reasonably determine sphericity of C60 fullerene, because there is
a cavity (isosurface) at the center of the ball.

3.15.2 Numerical algorithm
3.15.2.1 Analysis on the whole molecular surface
In summary, in the common task of quantitative analysis of molecular surface, what we need
to obtain are minima and maxima of a selected real space function (i.e. mapped function) on vdW

surface (or isosurface of a specific real space function), as well as quantitative indices such as V S ,
−

V S , V S ,  ,  + ,  − and so on. Here I briefly describe how these properties are computed in
2

Multiwfn, the basic steps are given below.
1. Grid data of electron density enclosed the entire molecular space is compute. The smaller
the grid spacing is used, the more accurate result you will get, however the more vertices will be
generated in next step and therefore you will wait longer time in step 3.
2. Marching Tetrahedra algorithm is performed by making use of the grid data generated above,
this step generally does not cost much computational time. The volume enclosed by the isosurface
is computed at the same time. This step generates vertices representing the isosurface, along with
their connectivity. Each neighbouring three vertices constitute a triangle (will be referred to as facet
below). Below example is a water molecule, vertices (red points) and connectivity (black lines) are
portrayed:

3. Since computing ESP is time consuming, in order to cut down overall computational time,
Multiwfn eliminates redundant points automatically. Specifically, if the distance between two points
is smaller than a specific value, one of the points will be eliminated, and the other point will be
moved to their average position. In above graph, the aggregated points such as those inside blue
circles will be finally merged to one point.
4. Calculate mapped function (ESP, 𝐼 ̅ and so on) at each vertex on the isosurface. For ESP, this
is the most time consuming step; however for such as 𝐼 ̅ and EAL, this step can be finished
immediately.
5. Locate and then output minima and maxima of the mapped function on the surface by
making use of connectivity. If the mapped function value at a vertex is both lower (larger) than that
at its first-shell neighbours and second-shell neighbours, then this vertex will be regarded as surface
minimum (maximum).

volume, area of total vdW surface, the area where the mapped function is positive and where is
negative. As an example, V S is computed as
N

V S = (1/ A) Ai Fi
i

where N is the total number of facets, A is the sum of area of all facets, Ai is the area of facet i, Fi is
the ESP value (or value of other mapped function) of facet i, which is calculated as the average of
ESP at the three vertices composing the facet.

3.15.2.2 Analysis on local molecular surface
In order to unveil more chemically useful information from distribution of mapped function on
vdW surface, Multiwfn supports three kinds of analyses for local vdW surface, as described below.
(1) Analysis of local molecular surface corresponding to various atoms
In this mode the whole molecular surface will be first decomposed to local surfaces
corresponding to individual atoms, and then all surface properties are calculated for these atomic
surfaces. This function is very helpful to study atomic properties. See Section 4.12.3 for example.
Note that atomic local regions on molecular surface cannot be uniquely defined. The rule
employed by Multiwfn is shown as follows, which is simple and has clear physical meaning. For
any given point r on the molecular surface, Multiwfn calculates weight w for all atoms via

wA = 1 −

| r − rA |
RA

where A denotes atomic index, rA and RA are coordinate and radius of atom A, respectively. The
surface point r is attributed to the atom that has the maximal weight. It can be seen that at the
position of nucleus of A, wA reaches its maximal value 1.0. wA linearly attenuates with increase of
the distance |r-rA|, it attains zero when the distance just equals to corresponding atomic radius. The
larger radius the atom has, the slower the weight attenuates, therefore the above definition of weight
makes larger sized atoms have higher possibility to cover broader range on molecular surface.
In Multiwfn it is also possible to perform analysis of local molecular surface corresponding to
a user-defined fragment, the region of the fragment is simply the sum of the regions of all the atoms
that constitute it.
(2) Analysis of local molecular surface around specific surface extreme
This kind of analysis is mainly used for measuring area and graphically revealing region of hole and -hole, see Section 4.12.10 for practical example, but it can also be used for other analysis
purposes if the mapped function is not chosen to be electrostatic potential.
In this mode, you need to select a surface extreme and set a criterion. When you select a surface
maximum (minimum), if a surface vertex is directly or indirectly connected to the surface extreme
and value of mapped function at this vertex is higher (lower) than the criterion, the vertex will be
selected, all the selected vertices collectively define the local molecular surface. In order to make
you intuitively understand how this mode defines the local surface around a selected surface extreme,
a graphical illustration is provided below, in this map one-dimension ESP distribution is used to
abstractly represent two-dimensions distribution of ESP on molecular surface.

(3) Analysis of local molecular surface based on Basin-like partition
Basin partition generally refers to partitioning the whole molecular space into individual local
spaces by employing zero-flux surfaces of gradient of a real space function as basin boundaries,
each basin contains a maximum, see Section 3.20.1 for detailed introduction. The same idea may
also be employed for partitioning the molecular surface. When this technique is adopted in
combination with ESP, some chemically useful information could be gained, see Section 4.12.11 for
practical example.
The algorithm of applying basin partition to molecular surface is proposed by me (to be
published). The main purpose is to determine the attribution relationship between surface vertices
and surface extrema. Because the mapped function may have both positive and negative values,
absolute value of the mapped function is firstly taken, then all surface vertices are considered in
turn. Iteration is performed for each surface vertex; in each step, the vertex temporarily moves
towards the neighbouring vertex having largest value, namely climbing up hill. The iteration
continues until the vertex reaches a surface extreme, which is just the extreme that the surface vertex
finally attributed to. Note that after usual quantitative molecular surface analysis, the connection
relationship between various surface vertices is already known, if vertex B is directly connected to
A, then B will be the neighbouring vertex of A. To make you better understand central idea of this
method, a figure is shown below

In this graph, the black curve represents the original ESP distribution, the cyan and black curves
collectively correspond to the absolute value of the ESP. The region enclosed by blue bracket

corresponds to the local surface corresponding to minimum 1, while the two pink brackets
respectively correspond to the two local surfaces corresponding to maxima 1 and 2.
For the above mentioned modes (2) and (3), if all the three vertices of a surface facet are
selected, this surface facet will be regarded as attributed to the selected local surface. Then the area
as well as average of mapped function of the selected local surface can be straightforwardly
evaluated.

3.15.3 Parameters and options
You will see below options in the main interface of quantitative analysis of molecular surface.
0 Start analysis now!: When this option is selected, the analysis boots up. All steps described
in last section will be implemented sequentially.
6 Start analysis without considering mapped function: This option also starts analysis like
option 0, however calculation and analysis of mapped function are skipped. This option is useful if
you are only interested in e.g. volume and area of molecular surface while value of mapped function
is not of interest.
1 The isovalue of electron density used to define molecular surface: Default value is 0.001,
corresponding to the most frequently used definition of vdW surface. In general, it is not
recommended to adjust this value.
2 Select mapped function: The mapped function to be studied can be selected by this option.
Such as ESP, 𝐼 ,̅ EAL and user-defined function (Section 2.7) are directly supported and can be
automatically computed by internal code of Multiwfn during the surface analysis. Alternatively, if
you intend to load value of mapped functions at all surface vertices from an external file, you should
choose "0 Function from external file", in this case you may analyze broader type of mapped
functions (e.g. Fukui function), see description of option 5 given below for more detail.
Note that by default the ESP is evaluated based on wavefunction, this process may be quite time-consuming for
large systems. However, if you choose "Electrostatic potential from atomic charge", then Multiwfn will evaluate
ESP based on atomic charges, which are loaded from a .chg file, the computational time will be reduced by several
orders. You can use main function 7 to calculate atomic charge and produce the .chg file, or you can write the .chg
file manually, see corresponding part of Section 2.5 on the .chg file format. Note that the analysis result will be
reasonable only when the method used to generate atomic charges can reproduce ESP well (e.g. CHELPG, MK and
ADCH methods). Also note that in some cases ESP generated by atomic charges differ significantly from the ESP
generated based on wavefunction, see J. Chem. Theory Comput., 10, 4488 (2014) for comprehensive discussion.

3 Spacing of grid points for generating molecular surface: This setting defines the spacing
of electron density grid data, see step 1 introduced in the last section. The spacing directly
determines the accuracy and computational cost of the analysis. Default value is suitable for general
cases. Increasing this value can reduce computational time evidently, however if this value is not
small enough, the vertices on the isosurface will be spare, this may cause missing or erroneous
locating of some extrema. In general, the results under the default spacing are accurate and reliable.
If you find some extrema were not located under default spacing, try to decrease spacing and rerun
the task.

178

3 Functions
4 Advanced options: Suboptions in this option is not needed to be frequently adjusted by
normal users.
(1) The ratio of vdW radius used to extend spatial region of grid data: The role of this
parameter is exactly identical to the parameter k introduced in Section 3.100.3. Enlarging this value
will lead larger spatial extension of grid data of electron density around molecule. If isovalue of
electron density is set to a lower value than default, or the system is negatively charged, you may
need to enlarge this parameter to ensure that the isosurface will not be truncated.
(2) Toggle if eliminating redundant vertices: If this option is switched to "No", then the
elimination of redundant vertices (step 3 described in last section) will be skipped, and you will
waste vast time to calculate mapped function at those meaningless vertices. If this option is switched
to "Yes", you will be prompted to input a distance criterion for merging adjacent vertices. Commonly,
0.4~0.5 times of grid spacing is recommended to be used as the criterion.
(3) Number of bisections before linear interpolation: Simply speaking, the larger the value,
the more exactly the isosurface (corresponding to vdW surface) can be generated. Enlarging this
value will bring additional cost in step 2. The generated isosurface under default value is exact
enough in general. You can decrease it to 2 even to 1 to save computational time, however decrease
it to 0 will frequently lead to false surface extrema.
(4) Toggle using focal-point approximation to evaluate ESP
I proposed a way to approximately estimate high-quality ESP with relatively lower
computational cost, this idea will be referred to as focal-point approximation (FPA). Specifically,
given the fact that electron density estimated by high-level method with large basis set can be
high

high

low
low
approximately expressed as 𝜌large BS ≈ 𝜌small BS + (𝜌large
BS −𝜌small BS ) , since ESP is linear to
high

electron density, high quality ESP (V) can thus be approximately estimated as 𝑉large BS ≈
high

low
low
𝑉small BS + (𝑉large
BS −𝑉small BS ), the cost is evidently much lower than calculating ESP directly

using the high-level method with large basis set.
If you want to use the FPA during ESP analysis, you should load the wavefunction file produced
by “high method / small basis-set” calculation after booting up Multiwfn, then enter the present
function and choose this option once to switch its status to “Yes”, then Multiwfn will ask you to
input paths of wavefunction files produced by “low method / small basis-set” and “low method /
large basis-set” calculations (obviously, their geometries must be exactly identical to the “high
method / small basis-set” wavefunction). Then in the stage of calculation of ESP, they will be
automatically adopted to evaluate high quality ESP via the FPA equation shown above.
5 Loading mapped function values from external file
By choosing proper suboption in this option, during surface analysis, the value of mapped
function at surface vertices can be loaded from external file rather than directly calculated by
Multiwfn. This option has two uses: (1) Reduce overall analysis cost (2) Analyze a special function
that cannot be calculated by Multiwfn, or the analyze a function requiring mathematical operations
and thus not directly available in present module (e.g. dual descriptor).
This option has four suboptions:
(0) Do not load mapped function but directly calculate by Multiwfn: This is default case.

(1) Load mapped function at all surface vertices from plain text file: If this option is
selected, then after generation of molecular surface, coordinate of all surface vertices (in Bohr) will
be automatically exported to surfptpos.txt in current folder. Then you can use your favourite program
to calculate mapped function value at these points, and write the values as the fourth column in this

Then input the path of this file (the name can still be surfptpos.txt), Multiwfn will directly read the
values. An exemplificative application of this option is given in Section 4.12.4.
Hint: If you will analyze a system twice or more times, and want to avoid calculating mapped
function values every time for saving time, at the first time you analyze the system, you can select
option 7 at post-processing interface to export coordinates and corresponding mapped function
values of surface vertices to vtx.txt in current folder. At next time you analyze the system, if you
choose this option, and input the path of the vtx.txt during the surface analysis, then mapped function
values will be directly loaded rather than re-calculated (See Section 4.12.1 for example).
(2) Similar to 1, but specific for the case of using cubegen utility of Gaussian: A file named
cubegenpt.txt will be generated in current folder after generation of molecular surface. This file is
very similar to surfptpos.txt, the difference is that in this file the first line is not presented, and
coordinate unit is in Å. Based on this file, you can make use of cubegen utility of Gaussian to
calculate mapped function at all surface vertices. After that, input the path of cubegen output file,
the data will be loaded by Multiwfn.
(3) Interpolate mapped function from an external cube file: After generation of molecular
surface, a template cube file named template.cub will be generated in current folder. Then you will
be prompted to input the path of a cube file representing the mapped function you are interested in,
the grid setting of this cube file must be exactly identical to template.cub. The mapped function
values at surface vertices will be evaluated by interpolation from the cube file you provided.

3.15.4 Options in post-processing menu
Once the all calculations of surface analysis are finished, a summary will be printed on screen.
Meanwhile below options will appear on screen used to check, adjust and export results.
-3 Visualize the surface: By this option you can directly visualize the isosurface analyzed.
-2 Export the grid data to surf.cub in current folder: The grid data used to generate
isosurface will be exported to the cube file surf.cub in current folder.
-1 Return to upper level menu
0 View molecular structure, surface minima and maxima: A GUI window will pop up if
this option is chosen. Red and blue spheres represent the position of maxima and minima. All
widgets are self-explanatory and hence not be referred here.

3 Functions

1 Export surface extrema as surfanalysis.txt in current folder: This option exports value of
mapped function and X, Y, Z coordinates of surface extrema to surfanalysis.txt in current folder.
2 Export surface extrema as surfanalysis.pdb in current folder: This option outputs surface
extrema to surfanalysis.pdb in current folder. The B-factor column records mapped function value
(the actually used unit is shown on screen).
3 Discard surface minima in certain value range: If the mapped function value at a surface
minimum is between the lower and upper limit inputted by user, then this minimum will be discarded
and cannot be recovered. This option is useful to screen the minima with too large value.
4 Discard surface maxima in certain value range: If the mapped function value at a surface
maximum is between the lower and upper limit inputted by user, then this maximum will be
discarded and cannot be recovered. This option is useful to screen the maxima with too small value.
5 Export present molecule as pdb format file: This option outputs structure of present system
to a specified pdb file. Since pdb is a widely supported format, in conjunction with the output by
option 2, surface extrema can be conveniently analyzed in external visualization softwares such as
VMD.
6 Export all surface vertices to vtx.pdb in current folder: This option outputs surface
vertices to vtx.pdb file in current folder, mapped function values are written to B-factor field (the
actually used unit is shown on screen). This option is mainly used to check validity of isosurface
polygonization and visualize distribution of mapped function on molecular surface.
There is a hidden option 66, which not only outputs surface vertices to vtx.pdb, but also outputs connectivity
into CONECT field of this file. If you would like to visualize connectivity based on the vtx.pdb in VMD program,
please consult my blog article "Setting connectivity of atoms according to CONECT field in VMD"
(http://sobereva.com/121, in Chinese)

coordinates in Bohr and mapped function values in various units.
8 Export all surface vertices and surface extrema as vtx.pqr and extrema.pqr: This option
exports all surface vertices and surface extrema as vtx.pqr and extrema.pqr in current folder,
respectively. The column originally designed for recording atomic charge in this format (i.e. the
third last column) is used to record mapped function value in a.u. Because recording precision in
this case is relatively high, if the value of mapped function is too small to be properly recorded as
B-factor field of .pdb file (e.g. Fukui function on vdW surface), obviously you should use this option
to replace options 2 and 6.
9 Output surface area in specific value range of mapped function
By this option, one can gain the knowledge of the distribution of molecular surface area in
various range of mapped function. First one needs to input the index range of the atoms in
consideration, then input overall range, interval and the unit. For example, one sequentially inputs
2,6-9, -45,50 and 10 and 3, the statistic then is applied on the local molecular surface corresponding
to atoms 2, 6, 7, 8 and 9, the output looks like below:

Sum:

where "begin" and "end" is the lower and upper limit of local value range, respectively. "Center" is
their average value. Area is in Å2, "%" denotes the proportion of the area in overall molecular surface
area.
10 Output the closest and farthest distance between the surface and a point
In this option, after defining a point (you can define a nuclear position or geometry center as
the point, you can also directly input the coordinate of the point), the closest and farthest distance
between the molecular surface and the point will be outputted. These two quantities have two main
uses:
(1) In atoms in molecules (AIM) theory, for systems in gas phase, the vdW isosurface is defined
as the ρ=0.001 a.u. isosurface. The closest distance between a nucleus and the surface can be
regarded as non-bonded atomic radius. For a non-covalently interacting atomic pair AB, the
difference between the length of A-B and the sum of their non-bonded radii is termed as mutual
penetration distance. In general, the larger the distance is, the stronger the interaction will be.
(2) The farthest distance between molecular surface and geometry center can be viewed as a
definition of molecular radius. Of course, the concept of molecular radius is only meaningful for
sphere-like molecules.
If you input f, Multiwfn will output the farthest distance between all surface points. This can
be regarded as a definition of molecular diameter.

11 Output surface properties of each atom
This option is used to realize the analysis of local molecular surface corresponding to various
atoms, as introduced in Section 3.15.2.2. After outputting the surface properties, the user can select
if outputting the surface facets to locsurf.pdb in current folder. If choosing "y", then in the outputted
pdb file, each atom corresponds to a surface facet, and the B-factor field records the attribution of
the surface facets, e.g. a facet having B-factor of 11.00 means the facet belongs to the local surface
of atom 11. If you load the pdb file into VMD and set "Coloring Method" as "Beta", then you can
directly visualize how the whole molecular surface is decomposed to atomic surfaces.
12 Output surface properties of specific fragment
Similar to function 11, but user can define a fragment, the surface properties will only be
calculated on the local surface corresponding to this fragment, so that one can study fragment
properties according to the local surface descriptors. Also, you can choose to output the surface
facets to locsurf.pdb in current folder, in which the atom having B-factor of 1 and 0 means
corresponding surface facet belongs to and does not belong to the local surface of the fragment you
defined, respectively.
13 Calculate grid data of mapped function and export it to mapfunc.cub
For example, if the mapped function you selected before the quantitative surface analysis is
ALIE, then if you select this option in post-processing menu, grid data of ALIE will be calculated
and exported to mapfunc.cub in current folder, the grid setting is the same as the one employed in
the quantitative surface analysis. Based on the surf.cub exported by option -2 and the mapfunc.cub,
you can plot color-mapped isosurface map via VMD program. Section 4.12.6 illustrates value of
this option.
14 Calculate area and function average in a region around a surface extreme
This option is used to realize the analysis "(2) Analysis of local molecular surface around
specific surface extreme" described in Section 3.15.2.2. The area as well as averaged mapped
function value of the local surface region will be printed on screen, and meantime a file selsurf.pqr
will be exported to current folder, you can load it into VMD program to visualize the selected local
surface region (drawing as "Points" method and coloring according to "Charge" property are
recommended, the charge column in this file correspond to the mapped function values in a.u.).
15 Basin-like partition of surface and calculate areas
This option is used to realize the analysis "(3) Analysis of local molecular surface based on
Basin-like partition" described in Section 3.15.2.2. The number of surface vertices of each surface
basin, the area of each surface basin, as well as average value of mapped function on each surface
basin are outputted. At the meantime, surfbasin.pdb is exported to current folder and it contains all
surface vertices, B-factor corresponds to index of the extreme that the vertex attributed to.
19 Discard some surface extrema by inputting indices
Sometimes due to numerical noise or other reasons, there are some unwanted surface extrema.
In this case you can use this option to conveniently remove them by inputting their indices.
Abundant examples of various kinds of quantitative molecular surface analyses can be found
in Section 4.12.

3.15.5 Special topic: Hirshfeld and Becke surface analyses
The quantitative molecular surface analysis module is also able to carry out Hirshfeld and
Becke surface analysis, present section is devoted to introducing this point.
Theory of Hirshfeld and Becke surface analyses
Hirshfeld surface analysis was first proposed in Chem. Phys. Lett., 267, 215 (1997) and
comprehensively reviewed in CrystEngComm, 11, 19 (2009). This method focuses on analyzing the
so-called Hirshfeld surface to reveal weak interactions between molecules in complex or in
molecular crystal.
Hirshfeld surface in fact is a kind of interfragment (or intermonomer) surface, which is defined
based on the concept of Hirshfeld weight. Probably Hirshfeld surface is the most reasonable way to
define interfragment surface.
Atomic Hirshfeld weighting function of an atom is expressed as

w AHirsh (r ) =

 A0 (r )
  B0 (r)
B

where 𝜌𝐴0 denotes the density of atom A in free-state. Summing up weight of all atoms in a fragment
yields Hirshfeld weight of this fragment

wPHirsh (r) =  wAHirsh (r)
AP

Hirshfeld surface of fragment P is just the isosurface of 𝑤𝑃Hirsh = 0.5.
Motivated by Hirshfeld surface, I proposed Becke surface, which replaces Hirshfeld weight
with Becke weight (see Section 3.18.0 for introduction of Becke weight), only geometry and atomic
covalent radii are required to construct Becke surface. Commonly the profile of Becke surface and
that of Hirshfeld surface are comparable. Hirshfeld surface is faster for large system and thus
preferred over than Becke surface in most cases, however Becke surface has an advantage that it
can be constructed normally in the region where electron density is vanished (very far from atoms),
in which region Hirshfeld weight is undefined and thus Hirshfeld surface cannot be constructed.
To intuitively illustrate Hirshfeld/Becke surface, acetic acid dimer in two-dimension case is
taken as example here

3 Functions
Hirshfeld weighting function of the monomer at left side of the graph is represented by color bar,
going from red to dark purple corresponds to the weight varying from 1.0 to 0.0. The black line,
which is the contour line of 0.5, is just its Hirshfeld surface. Evidently, Hirshfeld surface very
elegantly partitioned the whole space into two monomer regions, the difference in atomic size is
properly and automatically taken into account. The Hirshfeld surface in this case is an open surface,
the surface extends to infinity; while if the monomer is completely buried, such as in molecular
crystal or metal-organic framework environment, then its Hirshfeld surface will be a close surface
and encloses all of its nuclei, just like common molecular surface.
If we map specific real space functions on Hirshfeld/Becke surface and study their distributions,
just like quantitative analysis on molecular surface, we can gain many important information about
intermolecular interaction. There are three real space functions very useful for this purpose
(1) Normalized contact distance d norm =

d i − ri vdW d e − revdW
, where di (de) is the
+
ri vdW
revdW

distance from a point on the surface to the nearest nucleus inside (outside) the surface, 𝑟𝑖vdW and
𝑟𝑒vdW denote vdW radius of the corresponding two atoms. Small value of dnorm indicates close
intermolecular contact and implies evident interaction.
(2) Electron density. If electron density is large in some local regions of Hirshfeld/Becke
surface, obviously the intermolecular interactions crossing these regions must be prominent. The
usefulness of electron density is similar to dnorm, while the former is more physically meaningful
and leads to smoother color variation on the surface.
(3) sign(λ2), see corresponding part Section 2.6 for detailed explanation. This function can
not only exhibit interaction strength but also reveal interaction type.
Below is urea crystal, the isosurface represents Hirshfeld surface of the central urea, and dnorm
is the mapped function. Red parts correspond to small dnorm and thus exhibit close contact, which
mainly originates from H-bond interaction.

Fingerprint plot and local contact
The so-called "fingerprint plot" defined in the framework of Hirshfeld/Becke surface analysis
is useful in investigating the noncovalent interactions in molecular crystals. X and Y axes in this

185

3 Functions
plot correspond to di and de, respectively. Each vertex on the Hirshfeld/Becke surface is drawn as a
scatter point on the fingerprint plot. According to the distribution of the scatter points, possible
intermolecular interactions can be inferred. The usefulness of the fingerprint plot is demonstrated in
page 24 and 25 of CrystEngComm, 11, 19 (2009).
The Hirshfeld/Becke surface in fact can be viewed as the contact surface between the atoms in
the Hirshfeld/Becke fragment you defined and all other atoms. The remarkable flexibility of
Multiwfn allows the overall contact surface to be decomposed to various local contact surfaces and
draw the corresponding local fingerprint plots. For example, one can draw fingerprint plot for the
local contact surface between the nitrogen atoms in central urea and the hydrogens in surrounding
ureas. In this case, all vertices on the local contact surface simultaneously satisfy two conditions:
(1) In the Hirshfeld/Becke fragment (viz. the central urea), the atoms closest to the vertices are
nitrogen (2) Among all surrounding atoms, the ones closest to the vertices are hydrogen.
Undoubtedly, fingerprint plot of local contact surface greatly facilitates one to study the noncovalent
interaction in local region due to the contact between specific atom sets.
Usage
The procedure to perform Hirshfeld/Becke surface analysis is similar with usual quantitative
molecular surface analysis. After you entered main function 12, choose option 1 and select Hirshfeld
or Becke surface, then input the index of the atoms in the fragment. Now mapped function is
automatically switched to electron density (if no wavefunction information is available, it
corresponds to promolecular density). You can also choose option 2 to select other mapped function.
After that, choose option 0 to start calculation. Quantitative data on the surface such as average
value and standard deviation will be outputted, and surface extrema will be located. Then via
corresponding options you can visualize surface minima/maxima, export result and so on, all options
in the post-processing menu (except for option 20) have already been introduced in Section 3.15.4
and thus will not be described again.
In the post-processing menu you can see an option named "20 Fingerprint plot and local contact
analyses", after entering it you will see a menu, in which if you select option 0, the fingerprint
analysis will be started. By default, the analysis is performed over the entire Hirshfeld/Becke surface.
If you intend to perform fingerprint plot analysis for local contact region, you should use options 1
and 2 in this menu to respectively define "inside atoms" and "outside atoms", only the contact
surface between these two sets of atoms will be taken into account in the analysis. Any atom in the
"inside atoms" should be an atom in the current fragment, while any atom in the "outside atoms"
should not belong to the current fragment. In the options 1 and 2 you will be asked to input two
filter conditions, their intersection defines the set. Condition 1 is atom index range, the condition 2
is element. For example, if you input 1,3-6 as condition 1 and Cl as condition 2, then the Cl atom(s)
within the range of 1,3-6 will be chosen.
After carrying out the fingerprint plot analysis, the area of the contact surface will be shown
on screen. Then, in the new post-processing menu you can find many options, which can be used to
draw fingerprint plot or modify plotting settings. By option 4 you can export the vertices on the
local contact surface and entire Hirshfeld/Becke surface to finger.pqr and finger_all.pqr in current
folder, respectively, in which “Charge” property (penultimate column of the files) corresponds to
the value of mapped function. In addition, by option 5, you can export di and de values of the points
on the local contact surface and entire Hirshfeld/Becke surface to di_de.txt and di_de_all.txt in
current folder, respectively.
