molecular dynamics trajectory as input file, then enter subfunction -12 of main function 20, then
define fragments for amIGM analysis like standard IGM analysis (Section 3.23.5), then choose the
range of frames to be considered, and finally define a proper box for calculating grid data. After that,
various grid data will be calculated, and post-processing menu appears. In this menu, you can export
cube files of 𝛿𝑔̅ inter and averaged sign(λ2) as avgdg_inter.cub and avgsl2r.cub, respectively. There
is an option (-1) to plot scatter map between the two functions, which may be useful in the amIGM
analysis. You can can also export the averaged RDG (byproduct of amIGM analysis) and thermal
fluctuation index (TFI) mentioned Section 3.23.3 as cube files.
To plot 𝛿𝑔̅ inter isosurface map colored by averaged sign(λ2), you should put the exported
avgdg_inter.cub and avgsl2r.cub as well as examples\aIGM.vmd to VMD folder, then boot up VMD
and input source aIGM.vmd command in VMD console window to execute the plotting script, you
will immediately see the amIGM map.
An example of amIGM analysis is given in Section 4.20.13.

3.24 Energy decomposition analysis (21)
3.24.1 Energy decomposition analysis based on molecular forcefield
(EDA-FF)
Energy decomposition analysis (EDA) is an important method to reveal the nature of
interaction. Most EDA analysis methods are based on wavefunction, they are accurate, rigorous and
the results are meaningful, unfortunately they are often too expensive for large systems. Present
module is designed for analyzing intramolecular and intermolecular weak interactions based on
classical molecular force field (FF), this method could be referred to as EDA-FF, the computational
cost is negligible for systems consisting of hundreds of atoms, and it can even be applied to systems
with more than ten thousands of atoms. Due to limitation of FF, this module evidently cannot be
used to discuss the natural of chemical bond interactions. The word "weak interaction" in this section
refers to the interatomic interaction separated by more than three bonds.
If EDA-FF analysis is utilized in your work, please cite this article, in which I briefly described
EDA-FF and employed it in studying interaction between cyclo[18]carbon and graphene: Mat. Sci.
Eng. B, 273, 115425 (2021) DOI: 10.1016/j.mseb.2021.115425.
Theory
There are many popular FFs for molecular systems. The major ingredients of weak interactions
are van der Waals (vdW) interaction and electrostatic interaction, most FFs represent them by mean
of pairwise potential, as shown below.

where Erep represents repulsive interaction due to Pauli repulsion effect (also known as exchangerepulsion), while Edisp is attractive dispersion interaction. The AB is well depth of interatomic vdW
interaction potential, while R0AB is vdW nonbond distance. When rAB=RAB0, the interaction energy
just corresponds to well depth.
The parameters  and R0 are provided by FFs, and the values are commonly defined for each
atom type. The interatomic parameters used in practical calculation are commonly evaluated as
geometric average or arithmetic average of atomic parameters. For example, in UFF forcefield,
below mixing rule is used

 AB =  A B

0
RAB
= RA0 RB0

While for some other FFs such as AMBER and GAFF, atomic  and R*are defined, the employed
mixing rule is

 AB =  A B

0
RAB
= RA + RB

where R* is known as atomic nonbond radius or atomic vdW radius.
Given the interatomic interaction terms, evaluating various physical components of
interfragment interaction energy is straightforward:
ele
EIJele =  E AB
AI BJ

rep
EIJrep =  E AB
AI BJ

disp
EIJdisp =  E AB
AI BJ

The present module is mainly used to evaluate above three terms between two or more userdefined fragments, many useful quantities can be obtained at the meantime.
Usage
The basic steps of using this module are:
(1) Prepare a "molecule list" file, which contains paths of "molecule type" files. Detailed
description is given later.
(2) Load a file containing geometry information of the whole system. Evidently, many formats
supported by Multiwfn could be used, for example, .xyz, .mol, .pdb, .fch and so on.
(3) Enter subfunction 1 of main function 21.
(4) Use option 3 to load molecule list file. This step is used to assign atomic charge and type
for each atom.
(5) Use option 2 to define fragments. Infinite number of fragments may be defined, any atom
should not simultaneously appear in two or more fragments. If you want to study interaction between
two fragments in the same molecule, any atomic pair between the two fragments should be separated
by at least three bonds (otherwise the interaction will no longer belong to the scope of weak
interaction). Note that the order of the steps (4) and (5) could be exchanged.

(6) Choose option 1 to start analysis, then interaction energy components between each
fragment pair, as well as atomic contributions will be printed. Before the analysis, if you want to
check whether the charges and types have been properly assigned, you can choose option 4.
There are other options you can select before calculation:
·Option -1: This is used to choose the FF employed in the calculation. Currently, AMBER99
& GAFF (default) and UFF are supports, their difference is that the built-in atomic vdW parameters
and the mixing rule used in the calculation are different.
·Option -2: This option can choose the operator in calculating electrostatic interactions. By
default 1/r operator is employed, while using this option you can change it to 1/r2. Obviously, the
attenuation of Eele calculated based on 1/r2 with respect to interaction distance r is much faster than
the default case, this is why some studies employ this simple strategy to effectively exhibit water
environment, since it is well-known that polar solvents such as water can significantly shield
electrostatic interaction strength due to its large dielectric constant.
·Option -3: If you choose this option once to switch the status to "Yes", then after calculation,
all interatomic interaction energy terms including their physical components will be exported to
interatm.txt in current folder.
·Option -4: In the standard .pqr format, the last two columns are specific for storing atomic
vdW radii and atomic charges. If you choose this option once to switch the status to "Yes", then
during calculation, atmint_tot.pqr, atmint_ele.pqr, atmint_rep.pqr, atmint_disp.pqr and
atmint_vdW.pqr will be outputted in current folder, their last columns record atomic contribution to
total, electrostatic, repulsion, dispersion and vdW (i.e. repulsion + dispersion) interaction energies,
respectively. In the popular VMD visualization program, you can load one of these .pqr file and
color the atoms according to "atomic charges" data, then the atom colors will vividly exhibit
contribution of each atom to corresponding kind of interaction energy.
Next, I introduce the rule of writing the molecular list file. The content of the file should look
like this:
C:\mol1\phenol.txt 1
C:\mol2\H2O.txt 4
C:\HCl.txt 2

This example file implies that, in the geometry information provided by the file loaded when
Multiwfn boots up, the recording sequence is: one phenol molecule, four H2O molecules and two
HCl molecules. The three .txt files contain atom types (case sensitive) and charges of respective
molecule. For example, below is the content of the C:\mol2\H2O.txt, which records information of
the atoms in H2O molecule, the OW and HW are atom types of AMBER force field.
OW -0.728713
HW

0.364427

HW

0.364286

The first column is atom type corresponding to the FF you currently choose, the second column
corresponds to atomic charge. Notice that the atom sequence in this file must be exactly identical to
the geometry information loaded when Multiwfn boots up. If the forcefield employed in analysis is
UFF, then this file should only contain atomic charge, thus there should be only one column (because
for each element, all relevant atom types share the same UFF vdW parameters, therefore users do

not need to define atom types).
·About atom types: Detailed description of atom types can be found in original paper of
corresponding forcefields. For AMBER, see Table 1 of J. Am. Chem. Soc., 117, 5179 (1995). For
GAFF, see Table 1 of J. Comput. Chem., 25, 1157 (2004); you can also consult the AMBER99.txt
and GAFF.txt in "examples\EDA\EDA_FF" folder for description of atom types. In general, you can
manually find appropriate atom type for each atom in current system according to its actual chemical
environment. However, if you feel this process is troublesome, you can use third-part programs to
help you to identify atom types and construct the molecular files. For example, GaussView can
automatically assign AMBER atom types (enter "Atom List", click the icon with large organge "M"
symbol, double click head of "AMBER Type" column, select "File"-"Export Data", then extract the
data corresponding to "AMBER Type" column), while Antechamber utility in AmberTools package
is able to assign GAFF atom types. Note that AMBER and GAFF atom types can be mixed together
in the same molecule file, since these two forcefields are completely compatible with each other,
the AMBER and GAFF atom types use upper and lower case, respectively.
Note: The atom types assigned by GaussView are always in upper case, however, some atom types of
AMBER99 are lower case, e.g. Br. Clearly, you should manually make modification before loading the file into
Multiwfn. If you are confused, take a look at examples\EDA\EDA_FF\AMBER99.txt.

·On the choice of forcefield: For organic type of systems, commonly I suggest using
AMBER/GAFF forcefield to conduct the analysis, the result should be reasonable and chemically
meaningful. In fact, since vdW parameters of GAFF are directly inherited from AMBER, commonly
there should be no different between using GAFF and AMBER atom types. Evidently, the geometry
used in the analysis should be firstly optimized under reasonable level. Using UFF is generally
deprecated, since I found that when UFF is employed, the total interfragment interaction energy is
usually positive due to overestimation of Erep, even if the geometry has already been substantially
optimized with appropriate quantum chemistry method. A way to solve this problem is using the
geometry optimized by UFF itself (many programs can do this, such as Gaussian and OpenBabel),
however the resulting geometry for weakly interacting molecular dimer or multimer is often not
quite good. The unique advantage of UFF is that it covers almost entire periodic table. Considering
this, I designed a trick in Multiwfn: If you are using AMBER/GAFF, when atom type is written as
UF, then UFF vdW parameter will be employed. This treatment greatly extends the application
scope of AMBER and GAFF.
·On the choice of atomic charges: The atomic charges used for energy decomposition
analysis should be able to reproduce electrostatic potential (ESP) around molecular vdW surface
well. Commonly I suggest to use CHELPG atomic charge, which is obtained via ESP fitting process
and can be directly calculated via Multiwfn, see Section 3.9.10 for introduction and Section 4.7.1
for example. Note that if a type of molecule appears more than once in current system with
significantly different conformations, given that ESP fitting charges of each monomer may be very
different to others, it is suggested to treat these replicas as different types of molecules, so that
atomic charges can be individually assigned. If some monomers of the system is to large to calculate
their ESP fitting atomic charges, you may change to EEM atomic charges using the parameters fitted
for reproducing ESP fitting charges, see Section 3.9.15 for introduction. The computational cost of
EEM charges is negligible for a system even composed of hundreds of atoms, since the calculation

3.24.2 Shubin Liu's energy decomposition
Theory
In J. Chem. Phys., 126, 244103 (2007), the author Shubin Liu proposed an idea of energy
decomposition, which will be referred to as EDA-SBL below. In this method, the total molecular
energy is decomposed as

E = Esteric + Eelectrostatic + Equantum
The steric term is simply the energy derived by Weizsäcker kinetic functional, which corresponds
to the exact kinetic energy under assumption that the electrons in present system are non-interacting
bosons:

Esteric = TW =  (r) / [8 (r)]
2

The electrostatic term is the sum of all classical Coulomb interactions of the particles in the system:

Eelectrostatic = EJ + EN − E + EN − N =  

 (r1 )  (r2 )
ZA
Z Z
d r1 d r2 −   (r )
dr +  A B
r12
A | r − RA |
A B RAB

Finally, the quantum term is the energy purely caused by quantum effect:

Equantum = EPauli + EXC
where the EXC is exchange-correlation energy, the EPauli=TS-TW is Pauli kinetic energy, in which the
TS stands for total kinetic energy of non-interacting electron model and can be computed as the sum
of kinetic energy of all occupied molecular orbitals. The Equantum essentially exhibits electronic
correlation effect as well as influence of Pauli exclusion principle on electronic kinetic energy under
non-interacting particle assumption.
The EDA-SBL method has been employed in many research papers, such as the ones shown
below, which are suggested to read to if you want to understand how this method can be used to
study practical chemical problems: J. Phys. Chem. A, 117, 962 (2013), J. Chem. Phys., 133, 114110
(2010), Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys., 17, 27052 (2015), J. Phys. Chem. A, 119, 8216 (2015), Chem.
Phys. Lett., 687, 131 (2017).
Usage
The Multiwfn itself is unable to evaluate all terms in the EDA-SBL method, Multiwfn needs
to read relevant information from Gaussian output file. The way of using Gaussian to perform EDASBL analysis is summarized as follows:
(1) Manually create a special Gaussian input file of single point task based on optimized
geometry

309

--- page break ---

3 Functions
(2) Run the input file by Gaussian and get output file as well as fch/fchk file
(3) Boot up Multiwfn and load the fch/fchk file, then enter subfunction 2 of main function 21
(4) Input the path of the Gaussian output file
Then Multiwfn calculates the Esteric term, and prints all the three energy components defined
by the EDA-SBL method. Other intermediate terms involved in the EDA-SBL terms are also
simultaneously given, such as Pauli kinetic energy, nuclear-electronic Coulomb attraction energy
and so on.
The special Gaussian input file should be coincident with following format, the geometry has
been optimized using appropriate level.
%chk=H2O.chk

-5

The DFT functional and basis set can be arbitrarily chosen, the "ExtraLinks=L608" must be
specified so that Gaussian can break total energy into various components and print them to output
file. After calculation, the resulting H2O.chk should be converted to fch/fchk file using formchk
utility. As you can see, there is a value "-5" at the end of the input file, this value should be specified
according to the DFT functional you actually used, you can find corresponding value by consulting
IOp(3/74) in Gaussian IOp reference. The value for commonly employed hybrid functionals are:
-73 (MN15) -58 (B97XD), -55 (M06-2X), -54 (M06), -53 (M06L), -40 (CAM-B3LYP), -35
(TPSSh), -13 (PBE0), -5 (B3LYP), -6 (B3PW91), -3 (BHandHLYP), 402 (BLYP), 1009 (PBE), 2523
(TPSS).
An alternative way of finding the corresponding value of IOp(3/74) for present DFT functional is carrying out
a simple calculation and check the value of IOp(3/74) automatically shown at the beginning of the output file, for
example, the output file using B3LYP/6-31G* level will contain a line "3/5=1,6=6,7=1,11=2,16=1,25=1,30=1,
74=-5/1,2,3;", showing that the IOp(3/74) is -5. More explanation of ExtraLinks=L608 can be found in
http://gaussian.com/faq1/.
IMPORTANT NOTE for Gaussian with version  G16 C.01: According to response from Gaussian support, at
least for G16 C.01 or older, range-separated functionals such as B97XD and CAM-B3LYP are not compatible with
ExtraLinks=L608. In addition, for consistency reason, if you are using G16, you should also add value "5" after the
functional index to request Gaussian to use “ultrafine” grid for the ExtraLinks=L608, because “ultrafine” is the
default DFT grid since G16. For example, if you need to use M06-2X, you should write -55 5 rather than simply 55.

A practical example of EDA-SBL analysis is given in Section 4.21.2.

highly recommended to use! They can be easily performed using sobEDA.sh shell script based on

sobEDAw methods to perform very accurate, fast, convenient and universal energy decomposition

3.24.4 Analysis of atomic contribution to dispersion energy
Theory
For a DFT functional such as B3LYP whose ability to describe dispersion interaction is zero,
the well-known DFT-D3 dispersion correction energy can be approximately regarded as the
dispersion energy. This point has been proposed in J. Phys. Chem. A, 127, 7023 (2023), and further
confirmed in J. Chem. Theory Comput., 20, 1923 (2024) by comparing with the dispersion energy
calculated by DLPNO-CCSD(T). Without considering the three-body coupling term, the total
dispersion correction energy of DFT-D3 is the sum of the dispersion interaction energy between
each pair of atoms. Therefore, the contribution of atom A to dispersion energy of a system can be
calculated as 𝜀𝐴 = (1/2) ∑𝐵≠𝐴 𝜀𝐴,𝐵 , where 𝜀𝐴,𝐵 is DFT-D3 dispersion correction energy between
atoms A and B. Contribution of a fragment to dispersion energy is simply the sum of contributions
of its atoms. The dispersion interaction energy between two fragments is equal to the sum of the
dispersion interaction energy between each pair of atoms between them.
Furthermore, J. Chem. Theory Comput., 20, 1923 (2024) proposed the idea of dispersion energy,
which is defined as
𝜋 −3/2
2
𝜌disp (𝐫) = ( )
∑ 𝜀𝐴 𝑒 −𝛼(𝐫−𝐑𝐴 )
𝛼
𝐴

where  usually takes 0.5, RA is coordinate of atom A. Essentially, the 𝜌disp broadens atomic
contributions to dispersion energy into Gaussian functions to obtain a real space function, which
can be exhibited graphically.
The difference in dispersion energy contributed by a certain atom A shared by different
chemical environments (such as structures m and n) is denoted as ∆𝜀𝐴 . Replacing 𝜀𝐴 in the above
formula with ∆𝜀𝐴 results in the ∆𝜌disp function. If the nuclear coordinates used to calculate ∆𝜌disp
correspond to the structure m, then ∆𝜌disp can be used to color the atoms of structure m, or drawn
as isosurfaces and appended to structure map, to highlight the region contribute most to variation of
dispersion energy.
The aforementioned information is also true for other type of dispersion correction schemes,
such as DFT-D4, however Multiwfn currently only supports performing the analysis based on DFTD3.
Functions
All data in this module are calculated based on DFT-D3(BJ) dispersion correction energy with
parameters fitted for B3LYP. Periodic system is supported.
