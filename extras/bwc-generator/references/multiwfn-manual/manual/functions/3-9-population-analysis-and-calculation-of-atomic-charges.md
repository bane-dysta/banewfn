wavefunction to unrestricted wavefunction. More precisely, each spatial orbital will be split to an
alpha and a beta orbital, which have identical energy and shape but their occupancy may be different.
This option is useful for CDA analysis based on ROKS wavefunctions, see Section 4.16.4 for
example.
Subfunction 38: This option is used to make occupation of orbitals integer and satisfy Aufbau
principle. For example, originally the occupation of orbitals (from energy of low to high) is 2.0 1.95
1.93 0.09 0.03 0.0, then after using this option, the occupations will be 2.0 2.0 2.0 0.0 0.0 0.0. In
addition, if the number of electrons is an integer and the wavefunction was originally determined as
a multi-determinant wavefunction, this option will also automatically set the wavefunction type to
single-determinant. Note that this function assumes that the orbitals in the inputted wavefunction
file was ordered by energy from low to high.

3.9 Population analysis and calculation of atomic charges
(7)
This module is used to calculate population number of basis functions, shells, atoms, fragments,
or atomic charges. There are some points should be noted:
Regardless of which subfunction you choose, if you want to evaluate fragment
charge/population (the sum of charge/population of the atoms in a fragment), you should select
option "-1 Define fragment" first and input atom indices to define the fragment. Then once the
calculation of atomic charges is finished, fragment charge will be printed along with atomic charges.
If your input file is .chg or .pqr, which contains atomic charge information, this option also
automatically prints the sum of atomic charges of the atoms in the fragment.
After atomic charge calculation, you can choose to output atomic coordinates with calculated
charges to [name of loaded file].chg file in current directory, see Section 2.5 for detail about .chg
format.
If the file loaded when Multiwfn boots up is .chg format, you can use option "-2 Calculate
interaction energy between fragments based on atomic charges" in present function to evaluate
interfragment electrostatic interaction energy between two given fragments by classic Coulomb
formula (see below) using the atomic charges in this .chg file.

This feature is useful for studying electrostatic interaction component in total molecular interaction
energy, as well as evaluating intermolecular exciton coupling energy based on atomic transition
charges (see Section 4.A.9 on how to derive them).
If you are not familiar with atomic charges, it is strongly suggested to read my review article,

3.9.1 Hirshfeld atomic charge (1)
Hirshfeld is a very popular atomic population method based on deformation density partition,
Hirshfeld charge is defined as (Theor. Chim. Acta (Berl.), 44, 129 (1977))

qA = −  wAHirsh (r) def (r)d r
where

 def (r ) =  (r ) −  pro (r )
 pro (r ) =   Afree (r − R A )
A

w AHirsh (r ) =

 Afree (r − R A )
 pro (r )

It can also be rewritten as follows to make its physical meaning clearer

q A = −  wAHirsh (r )[  (r ) −  pro (r )]d r
= −  wAHirsh (r )  (r ) −  Afree (r − R A ) d r
= −  wAHirsh (r )  (r ) d r +   Afree (r − R A ) d r
= − pA + Z A
where pA is population number of the atom in actual chemical system. Z is nuclear charge, which
equals to the number of electrons carried by the atom in its free state.
The advantages of Hirshfeld population are:
1. Result is qualitatively consistent with general chemical concepts such as electronegativity
rule.
2. The weighting function w for space partition has clear physical meaning.
3. Unlike the methods based on integrating electron density such as AIM charge, what the
Hirshfeld charge reflects is the amount of transferred electron density during molecule formation,
the density not transferred is not involved.
4. Insensitive to the quality of wavefunction.
5. Although calculating Hirshfeld charge needs integration in real space, due to the smooth
integrand, sophisticated density functional theory (DFT) grid-based integration schemes can be
directly used, so Hirshfeld population is high-efficient.
6. The wide application field. Deformation density data can also be obtained by X-ray
crystallography experiments. Moreover, the applicability of Hirshfeld population is not constrained
by the type of wavefunction, the method can be directly applied to solid system, where the
wavefunction generally be described by plane-wave functions.
The disadvantages of Hirshfeld population are the charge is always too small and the poor

83

reproducibility of observable quantities, such as molecular dipole moment and ESP, the reason is
Hirshfeld population completely ignores atomic dipole moments.
After calculation, if the printed sum of all Hirshfeld charges is very close to integer, that means
the quadrature is accurate; if not, that means the outputted Hirshfeld charges are unreliable, you
need to increase the density of integration points by setting “radpot” and “sphpot” to larger value
and calculate again. For balancing computational time and accuracy, the default value of “radpot”
and “sphpot” are 75 and 434, respectively, you can set them to 100 and 590 respectively to obtain
more accurate results.
An example is given in Section 4.7.1.
Information needed: GTFs, atom coordinates

3.9.2 Voronoi deformation density (VDD) atom population (2)
The only difference between VDD and Hirshfeld population is the weighting function w. In
VDD population, the Voronoi cell-like partition is used, each cell corresponds to an atom, see J.
Comput. Chem., 25, 189 (2004) for details.
The results of VDD population are similar to Hirshfeld population in common, because the
magnitude of deformation density is always small, so there is no significant change in charges when
different weighting functions are used. The outputted terms are identical to Hirshfeld population.
Personally, I suggest you use Hirshfeld population instead of VDD.
Note that if the sum of VDD atomic charge deviates from molecular net charge evidently, that
means the numerical integration accuracy is not satisfactory, and hence you should enlarge "sphpot"
parameter in settings.ini to improve the result. "radpot" parameter also influences the result, but not
so significantly as "sphpot".

3.9.3 Mulliken atom & basis function population analysis (5)
Theory
Mulliken analysis is the oldest population method based on orbital wavefunction, supported by
almost all quantum chemistry packages.
Orthonormality condition of spin orbital wavefunction entails 1 =

where S a ,b =

  (r)  (r) d r , the normality of basis functions are used in derivation. The first
a

b

term is “local term”, denotes the net population of each basis function in orbital i, the second term
is “cross term”, denotes the shared electrons between basis function pairs in orbital i. Certainly the
local terms should be completely attributed to corresponding basis functions, however for cross
terms the partition method is not unique. Mulliken defined the population of basis function a in spin
orbital i as

 i ,a = C a2,i +  C a ,i Cb,i S a ,b
ba

That is each cross term 2C a ,i Cb ,i S a ,b is equally partitioned to corresponding two basis functions.
The population number of atom A is simply the sum of population numbers of all basis
functions attributed to atom A in all orbitals. Mulliken atomic charge is defined as

q A = Z A −  ni , A = Z A −  i   i ,a
i

i

aA

where  is orbital occupation number, ni,A is the contribution from orbital i.
Mulliken analysis is not ideal for practical application due to these shortcomings:
1. Poor reproducibility of observable properties such as molecular dipole moment
2. The “equal partition” of cross term has no strict physical meaning
3. Very high basis set dependence. In particular, diffuse function must not be presented,
otherwise the result will be misleading.
4. Occasionally, meaningless result occurs (population number is negative).
Usage
Since amount of outputted information is huge for large systems, before selecting below
subfunctions, you can use option -1 to change the default output destination from screen to a specific
plain text file.
·Subfunction 1 (Output Mulliken population and atomic charges): Population of basis
functions, population of basis function shells, population of each angular moment of atomic orbitals,
as well as atomic charges are printed.
·Subfunction 2 (Output gross atomic population matrix and decompose it): Gross atom
population matrix is printed, from which you can get local terms of each atom (diagonal element)
and cross terms between each atomic pair (non-diagonal element multiplies 2). The matrix element
is defined as

Note that the last row of outputted matrix is the sum of corresponding column elements, that
is the total population number of corresponding atom. You can also choose to decompose the matrix
to contribution of each occupied orbital, the  matrices will be outputted to groatmdcp.txt in current
directory.

By the way, the quantity 2𝐴,𝐵
is just the Mulliken bond order between atom A and B
contributed from orbital i, as we will see in Section 3.11.4.

Likewise, in subfunction 2, the last row of the outputted matrix is total population number of

namely 𝑖𝑎,𝑏 , to grobasdcp.txt in current directory (notice that this file is extremely large even for
medium-sized system).

3.9.4 Löwdin atom & basis function population (6)
The only difference between Löwdin and Mulliken population analysis is whether Löwdin
orthogonalization is performed first. In Löwdin orthogonalization, the transformation matrix is

X = Us1/2UT
where U is eigenvector matrix of overlap matrix, matrix s is diag(1, 2...), where {} is eigenvalue
set of overlap matrix. After Löwdin orthogonalization, the overlap matrix becomes identity matrix,
and new coefficient matrix is X-1C.
Ostensibly, Löwdin population avoids the partition for cross terms since they have become
zero, actually, the partition step is no more than hidden in the orthogonalization. Since Löwdin
orthogonalization still has no strong physical meaning, it cannot make conclusion that Löwdin
population is better than Mulliken. In view of practical results, one also found Löwdin charges have
no any evident advantages relative to Mulliken charges, though some people argued that Löwdin
charges have better basis set stability and reproducibility of molecular dipole moment. Besides,
Mayer et. al. found Löwdin population has rotation dependence to some extent when Cartesian type
Gaussian basis functions are used, however the dependency can be safely ignored in generally, for
detail please see Chem. Phys. Lett., 393, 209 (1968) and Int. J. Quantum Chem., 106, 2065 (2006).

3.9.5 Modified Mulliken atom population defined by Ros & Schuit
(SCPA) (7)
Some people had proposed several different partition methods of cross term to improve
Mulliken analysis, they are generally called as modified Mulliken population analysis (MMPA). In
the method proposed by Ros and Schuit (Theo. Chim. Acta, 4, 1 (1966)), the composition of basis

only the square of coefficients are presented in the formula, so this method is also called C-squared
Population Analysis (SCPA). By inserting the identity

It is clear that when calculating composition of basis function a in orbital i, what is partitioned is
not the cross terms between atom a and other atoms, but the total cross term of all atomic pairs. The
SCPA atomic charges can be calculated in the same manner as Mulliken charges by using the newly
defined . Relative to Mulliken population, the advantage of SCPA is that negative value of
population number never occurs.

3.9.6 Modified Mulliken atom population defined by Stout & Politzer

Stout and Politzer defined the  as (Theor. Chim. Acta, 12, 379 (1968))

Ca2,i
2Ca ,iCb ,i Sa ,b
2
2
b  a Ca ,i + Cb ,i

i ,a = Ca2,i + 

That is cross terms are partitioned according to the ratio of the squares of corresponding coefficients.
Ostensibly, this definition has more consideration on the unbalanced nature of cross term, however
in practical applications the results are even worse than Mulliken, therefore this method is rarely
used now. Besides, Grabenstetter and Whitehead had pointed out that this MMPA definition has
unitary transformation dependence, so if the molecule is rotated the results changed (the dependence
is remarkable and cannot be ignored).

the weight wa,b is only related to local terms of basis functions a and b in current orbital, while in
present method the weight is related to total local terms of basis functions a and b.

3.9.8 Becke atomic charge with atomic dipole moment correction (10)
In the paper J. Chem. Phys., 88, 2547 (1988), Becke proposed a weighting function for
converting whole space integral to multiple single-center spherical integrals, although the weighting
function is not intending for population analysis, Multiwfn still makes an attempt to use this
weighting function as atomic space to obtain atomic charges. The Becke charge can be defined as

qA = Z A −  wA (r )  (r) d r
The radii used for evaluating the Becke weighting function (or say Becke atomic space) can be
controlled by uses, see corresponding options shown on screen. For details about Becke weighting
function please see J. Chem. Phys., 88, 2547 (1988) or Section 3.18.0. According to my experiences,
by using the default "modified CSD" radii, Becke charge is reasonable for typical organic systems,
but not very appropriate for ionic systems. For detail about "modified CSD" radii, see the end of
Section 3.18.0.
After the Becke charges are calculated, atomic dipole moment correction will be performed
automatically. The correction process is identical to the one used for correcting Hirshfeld charge
(see next section). After the correction the charges will have better electrostatic potential
reproducibility and can exactly reproduce molecular dipole moment.

3.9.9 Atomic dipole moment corrected Hirshfeld atomic charges
(ADCH, 11)
Basic characteristic and usage
The main reason why Hirshfeld charges are too small and have poor reproducibility of

88

3 Functions
observable quantity is that atomic dipole moments are completely neglected. In the ADCH method
proposed by me (J. Theor. Comput. Chem., 11, 163 (2012)), atomic dipole moment of each atom is
expanded to correction charges placed at neighbouring atoms, then ADCH charge is just the sum of
original Hirshfeld charge and correction charge. ADCH atomic charges are very reasonable in
chemical sense, molecular dipole moment is exactly reproduced, the reproducibility of ESP is close
to the atomic charges obtained from fitting ESP. Compared to another method that try to improve
Hirshfeld charges, namely Hirshfeld-I (see Section 3.9.13), the computational cost of ADCH charge
is negligible. Owing to its many advantages, ADCH is a highly recommended atomic charge model.
For an extensive comparison of atomic charge models, see Acta Phys. -Chim. Sin, 28, 1 (2012).
Before doing ADCH correction, Hirshfeld charge will be calculated first. In the summary field,
“corrected” and “before” correspond to ADCH charge and Hirshfeld charge respectively. At final
stage, the “Error” means the the difference between molecular dipole moment produced by ADCH
charges and the one produced by actual electron density, “Error” is always equals to or very close
to zero, because ADCH charges in principle exactly reproduce molecular dipole moment.
If you would like to obtain the detail of charge transfer between atoms in the atomic dipole
moment correction process, you can set “ishowchgtrans” in settings.ini to 1.
Algorithm detail about expanding atomic dipole moment
Full details of ADCH charge can be found from its original paper, here I only mention how the
atomic dipole moment correction (ADC) is realized.
Assume that we want to expand atomic dipole moment of atom A as correction charges, clearly,
the sum of all correction charges should be zero, and the dipole moment evaluated based on the
correction charges should be exactly equal to atomic dipole moment, namely below conditions
should be satisfied

 q

A→ B

=0

B

μ A =  q A→ B R B
B

where qA→B is transferred charge from atom A to B, in other words, it is the correction charge on
atom B due to A. The index B cycles all atoms in the system. RB is relative coordinate (column
vector) of atom B with respect to atom A
The correction charges are expected to be distributed only around atoms neighbouring to A,
this could be realized by minimizing function F:

F =
B

( q A→ B ) 2

 AB

+   q A→ B +  (μ A −  q A→ B R B )

B

where  and  are Lagrangian multipliers used to satisfy the two constraint conditions, the AB is a
function decreases rapidly as increase of distance between A and B, and its detailed form is
dependent of atomic radii of A and B, see original paper of ADCH for more information. Obviously,
this design of F suppresses occurrence of large correction charge on the atoms far away from atom
A.
It is shown that after some manipulations, the working equation of evaluating qA→B is

q A→ B =

If the atom A is in local planar region, the  matrix will be exactly or almost singular matrix,
in this case inversed matrix of  obviously cannot be obtained. Notice that the solution to this
problem in current implementation is slightly different to the one introduced in the ADCH original
paper. In current Multiwfn, the  matrix is first diagonalized, the eigenvalues with absolute value
less than 10-5 will be simply set to zero (the corresponding eigenvector typically perpendicular to
the local plane of atom A), and remaining eigenvalues are inversed, now this matrix has
corresponded to the -1 in the new local coordinate. Then 𝐑 𝐵 − 〈𝐑 𝐵 〉 and A are transformed to the
new local coordinate by doing left multiplication of transpose of eigenvector matrix of  on them.
Finally, the qA→B is obtained using above formula.
An example of calculating ADCH charges is given in Section 4.7.2.

3.9.10 CHELPG (Charges from electrostatic potentials using a grid
based method) ESP fitting atomic charge (12)
Theory
CHELPG (J. Comput. Chem., 11, 361 (1990)) is one of most widely used electrostatic
potentials (ESP) fitting charge models. Compared to CHELP and Merz-Kollman methods, CHELPG
charges have better rotational invariance, mostly due to the fitting points are distributed in cubic
grid manner.
In CHELPG model, a box is defined first to enclose the whole molecule, extension distance in
each side is 2.8 Å, see the red box in the following picture

Fitting points are evenly distributed in the box, the default spacing is 0.3 Å. For any fitting

point, if the distance between the point and any nucleus is smaller than vdW radius of the atom, or
the distances between the point and all nuclei are larger than 2.8 Å, then the fitting point will be
discarded. The purple dots shown above are finally used fitting points.
Like other ESP fitting methods, in CHELPG, the deviation function shown below is minimized
to make the ESP calculated by atomic charges (Vq) close to the ESP calculated based on
wavefunction (V) as good as possible.

F (q1 , q2 ...qN ) = [Vq (ri ) − V (ri )]2
i

where ri is coordinate of fitting point i. {q} are fitted point charges, their positions are referred to as
fitting centers. Notice that q does not necessarily correspond to atomic charge, the fitting centers
can be defined at arbitrary positions.
It can be shown that the minimization of F could be formulated to below matrix equation

Aq = B

Usage
In the interface there are many options, which are introduced below.
• Option 1: If selecting this option, Multiwfn will start to calculate ESP value at each fitting
point, then fitted atomic charges of all fitting centers will be outputted on screen. RMSE and
RRMSE are also outputted automatically, they measure quality of fitting, the smaller value suggests
that the fitted charges have better ESP reproducibility. RMSE and RRMSE are defined as (where N
is the number of fitting points)

• Option 4: If you hope fitting points only distribute over certain fragment, you can select this
option and input atom indices, then a fitting point will be taken into account only if the atom closest
to it belongs to the given atom list.
• Option 5: During the ESP fitting, three kinds of ESP can be calculated and used, namely
"Nuclear + Electronic" (default), "Electronic" and "Transition electronic". Commonly you should
not change this option. The "Transition electronic" should be chosen if you want to evaluate the socalled TrEsp (transition charge from electrostatic potential), please check Section 4.A.9 for details.
• Option 6: If you have chosen this option once to switch its status to "Yes", then after
calculation, coordinates with ESP values of all fitting points can be exported to ESPfitpt.txt or
ESPfitpt.pqr in current folder, the former is more readable, while the latter can be directly loaded
into VMD program to visualize the fitting points (and can be colored according to the "charge"
column, which records ESP values). In addition, fitting points with absolute difference between
exact ESP and the ESP evaluated based on atomic charges can be exported to ESPerr.pqr so that
ESP reproduction error in various molecular regions can be visualized in VMD. See Section 4.7.8
for illustration.
• Option 10: Choose the atomic radii used in fitting. The atomic radii employed in fitting affects
the distribution of fitting points, and thus influence the resulting charges. There are three modes can
be chosen to set the radii:
(1) This is default mode, the radii defined in original paper of CHELPG are used. However,
only the elements in the first three rows are defined, if your system contains other elements,
Multiwfn will ask you to input their vdW radii in turn. If you do not have proper radii in hand, you
can directly press ENTER button, then vdW radius of UFF forcefield of corresponding element
multiplied by 1/1.2 will be used, which is commonly a reasonable choice.
(2) Employing the UFF radii scaled by 1/1.2 for all elements. The UFF radii can be find in
Table 1 of UFF original paper J. Am. Chem. Soc., 114, 10024 (1992).
(3) Load radii of all elements involved in present system from external file. Multiwfn will ask
you to input the file path during fitting, the format of the file should like follows, the unit of the radii
should be in Å, all elements in the system must be defined:
H 1.2
O 1.8
Cu 2.2

• Option -1: For flexibility consideration, by using this option, coordinates of fitting points are
allowed to be read from external file to replace the CHELPG fitting points. The format of the file
should be
numdata
X Y Z [ESPval]
 For fitting point 1
X Y Z [ESPval]
 For fitting point 2
...
where the ESPval is an optional term, which denotes precalculated ESP value at corresponding point.
If numdata is a negative value, then the ESP values used in charge fitting will be read from the
fourth column rather than calculated by Multiwfn.
• Option -2: If you have special reasons (e.g. you want to place additional fitting centers at lone
pair or -hole region to enhance description of ESP around corresponding region), then coordinates

92

3 Functions
of additional fitting centers can be read from external file by using this option. The format of the
file should be
numdata
X Y Z
 For additional fitting center 1
X Y Z
 For additional fitting center 2
...
where numdata denotes how many entries are in this file. X, Y, Z are coordinates (in Å).
• Option -3: If you simply want to examine reproducibility for ESP at the fitting points of given
atomic charges, then you can use this option to load atomic charges from specific .chg file. Then
when you select option 1 to start the ESP fitting process, no ESP fitting charges will be yielded, only
the RMSE and RRMSE of the given atomic charges will be outputted (note that if you have chosen
option -2 to load additional fitting centers, then the number of charges in the loaded .chg file should
be identical to the total number of fitting centers). If you only want to study reproducibility of ESP
for the fitting points around specific fragment, you can choose option 4 and input the atom indices.
An example is given in Section 4.7.1.

3.9.11 Merz-Kollmann (MK) ESP fitting atomic charge (13)
Merz-Kollmann (MK) charge is another well-known charge model derived from ESP fitting,
see J. Comput. Chem., 11, 431 (1990). The only difference between MK and CHELPG is grid setting.
In MK, the fitting points are evenly distributed on the layers of 1.4, 1.6, 1.8 and 2.0 times the vdW
radius of each atom, if distance between a fitting point and any atom is smaller than 1.4 times of its
vdW radius, then this fitting points will be discarded.
In the MK module of Multiwfn, the density of points per Å2 on the MK layers can be set by
option 2, the number of layers and the scale factor of atomic vdW radii used to define the layers can
be set by option 3, the atoms used to construct the MK fittings points can be set by option 4. For
description of other options and outputs, see last section.
Like the CHELPG module, in the MK module you can also choose the mode for determining
atomic radii used in the fitting by option 10. Notice that the original paper of MK method does not
explicitly present atomic radii. In Multiwfn, the default MK radii for the first and second rows and
P, S, Cl are in line with those in MK code of Gaussian, while the default radii for Na~Si are defined
as 1.57, 1.65, 1.65, 1.80 Å, respectively.
In the example in Section 4.7.8, I exemplified how to use the MK module to investigate ESP
reproducibility of given atom charges on all MK fitting points and on the fitting points
corresponding to specific atoms. In addition, the example showed how to visualize ESP reproduction
error at various molecular regions.

3.9.13 Hirshfeld-I atomic charge (15)
Hirshfeld-I (HI) method was proposed in J. Chem. Phys., 126, 144111 (2007), it is an important
extension of Hirshfeld method. It is believed that the atomic space defined by Hirshfeld is not quite
ideal, because it does not respond actual molecular environment. In HI, atomic spaces are gradually
refined via an iterative scheme. After convergence, the final HI atomic spaces are evidently more
physically meaningful than the Hirshfeld ones.
There are some variants of HI method, including the Hirshfeld-E proposed in J. Chem. Theory
Comput., 9, 2221 (2013), the Hirshfeld-I proposed in J. Comput. Chem., 32, 1561 (2011) and the
fractional occupation Hirshfeld-I (FOHI) proposed in J. Chem. Theory Comput., 7, 1328 (2011).
Also, there is an iterative atomic space method name iterated stockholder atoms (ISA), which is
closely related to HI, see Chem. Commun., 2008, 5909.
Basic theory of HI method
In HI method, the weighting function of atom A at iteration n is defined as

wA( n ) (r − R A ) =

 A( n−1) (r − R A )
 A( n−1) (r − R A )

( n −1)
pro
(r )
 B( n−1) (r − R B )
B

where r and R denote spatial coordinate and position of atomic nucleus, respectively. The atomic
density involved in HI is obtained by linear interpolation between spherically averaged free-state
atomic density of adjacent charge states:
( n −1)
 A( n ) (r ) = (qup − qA( n−1) )  Afree
− qlow )  Afree
,low ( r ) + ( q A
,up ( r )

where qhigh and qlow are upper and lower integer of atomic charge of atom A at n-1 iteration, while
free
free
𝜌𝐴,up
and 𝜌𝐴,low
are spherically averaged atomic density of atom A at these two charged states,
respectively. For example, if atom A carries charge of 0.2 at n-1 step, then its radial atomic density
at step n will be computed as
free
 A( n ) (r ) = 0.8   Afree
,q =0 ( r ) + 0.2   A,q =+1 ( r )

Before the HI iteration, radial density of all atoms are initialized to their neutral state.
Based on HI atomic weighting functions, HI atomic charges can be straightforwardly obtained.
The HI iteration continues until all atomic charges converged to a given criterion.
Note: It is clear that the HI atomic charges yielded at the first iteration are in principle identical to Hirshfeld
charges. However, this is not exactly true in Multiwfn, because currently the rule of generating spherically averaged
free-state atomic density involved in HI is not completely identical to that used in Hirshfeld, but the difference is
very small and can be ignored. It is never incorrect to directly take the atomic charges printed at the first iteration of

3 Functions
HI as Hirshfeld charges.

Usage
After entered the HI analysis module, you will find many options, you can adjust convergence
criterion and maximum number of cycles, also you can switch the algorithm for realizing HI
iterations (see below), and you can decide if printing atomic charges every iteration.
If you select option 0, Multiwfn will start the HI calculation. Before this, Multiwfn first checks
atomic radial density files (.rad) in "atmrad" folder, if they are available for all elements in the
current system, HI calculation will directly start; if they are not available, Multiwfn will try to
calculate atomic .wfn files by invoking Gaussian and convert them to .rad files, and then start the
HI iterations.
After convergence of HI iterations, HI atomic charges and fragment charge/population (if you
have defined fragment) are printed. Note that the printed HI atomic charges have been properly
normalized to eliminate noise of numerical integration (i.e. making sum of HI population of all
atoms equal to total number of electrons). Finally, you can select if outputting resulting atomic
charges as .chg file.
There is an option "-3 Switch if speeding up calculation using distance cutoff". By default, this treatment is
enabled to significantly reduce cost for large system. If you find the HI charges are problematic or the calculation
cannot be normally finished, you can select this option once to disable this treatment and retry. Alternatively, you
can select it twice, then you will be prompted to input a cutoff value for this treatment, the larger the value, the more
accurate the result and more robust the calculation will be, however, at the expense of increasing computational cost.
The default cutoff is 2.0, which should be very safe for almost all cases.

About preparing atomic radial density files (.rad files)
Before igniting HI iteration, atomic radial density files (.rad files) must be available for all
elements in the systems at different charged states. There are three ways to provide them:
• Using built-in .rad files
The easiest way of providing the .rad files is simply copying the "atmrad" folder from
"examples" directory to current folder, then Multiwfn will directly utilize the .rad files in it during
HI calculation. This "atmrad" folder contains .rad file of all elements (except for lanthanides and
actinides) of all possible charged states, therefore in this case HI charges can be directly computed
without any additional step.
The .rad files in this folder were carefully generated based on highly accurate densities. Specifically, elements
of the first three rows were calculated at PBE0/def2-QZVPP level, all other main group elements were calculated by
PBE0/ANO-RCC with DKH2 relativistic Hamiltonian, while all transition metal atoms were calculated by
PBE0/Sapporo-DK3-QZP-2012 with DKH2. For each element of each charged state, ground state spin multiplicity
was employed, and meantime wavefunction stability test and wavefunction optimization were carried out to make
sure that the wavefunction is stable and thus the resulting radial density is realistic.

• Let Multiwfn automatically invoke Gaussian to generate .rad files
If needed .rad files are not found in "atmrad" folder, Multiwfn will invoke Gaussian to calculate
atomic wavefunctions and generate .rad files, there are below two steps. Note that .rad file cannot
be generated in this way for lanthanides and actinides.
(1) Generating atomic .wfn files in "atmrad" folder: Multiwfn generates Gaussian input files
(.gjf) in "atmrad" subdirectory in current folder and invokes Gaussian to run them to generate
atomic .wfn files for all elements involved in present system. Charge states ranging from -2 to +2
are taken into account, while calculation of meaningless charge states are skipped. For example, its
meaningless to calculate -2 and +2 charge states for alkali elements, since in practical systems it is
impossible that an alkali atom has atomic charge between -1 to -2, or between +1 to +2. The
multiplicity of each charge state of each element is set to ground state (this cannot be well guaranteed

95

--- page break ---

3 Functions
for all cases, for example, ground state at different calculation levels may even be different. However,
this is never an important problem, so please do not concern it too much). The path of Gaussian
executable file should be set by "gaupath" in settings.ini file, if it is not properly set, you will be
prompted to input it in the Multiwfn interface. You also need to input the keywords of Gaussian
used to calculate the atomic .wfn files. After Gaussian calculation has finished, the atomic .wfn files
are generated in "atmrad" folder, the file name directly corresponds to element name and charge
state. For example, the file corresponding to -1, 0, +1 and +2 charged states of Be will be generated
in "atmrad" folder as Be-1.wfn, Be_0.wfn, Be+1.wfn and Be+2.wfn, respectively. If corresponding
file has already been found in the "atmrad" folder, then the file will be directly used and not be
recalculated. If you find Gaussian calculation is failed (mostly due to SCF nonconvergence problem),
you should carefully check Gaussian output file and properly adjust the keywords used.
(2) Converting atomic .wfn files to .rad files: As mentioned earlier, HI calculation requires
spherically averaged atomic densities. However, the electron density corresponding to the
atomic .wfn files generated at last step often does not meet this requirement. For example, carbon
at its neutral ground state has s2p2 configuration, and thus C_0.wfn corresponds to elliptical density
distribution. To get spherically averaged representation of atomic densities, Multiwfn automatically
loads each atomic .wfn files in "atmrad" folder, calculates spherically averaged radial density, and
write the data as .rad file, whose name is identical to its parental .wfn file. For example, C_0.wfn
will be converted to C_0.rad. The .rad file is a plain text file, the first line is the number of data
points, the first and second columns respectively correspond to radial distance with respect to
nucleus (in Bohr) and corresponding electron density. Note that if needed .rad file has already
presented in "atmrad" folder, then the conversion of .wfn→.rad will be skipped.
Note: If you are using Windows version of Multiwfn and Gaussian cannot be invoked properly, please read
Appendix 1 to set environment variable for Gaussian.
It is best (but never compulsory) that the atomic .wfn files are generated at the same calculation level as the
molecule under study, so that the result has strict physical meaning. If you want to let Multiwfn regenerate all needed
atomic .wfn/.rad files at a specific level prior to HI analysis, evidently you should clean up the "atmrad" folder before
calculation.

• Manually generate .rad files
It is also possible to manually calculate .rad files and put them in the "atmrad" folder, so that
they will be used in HI calculation. At least .rad files corresponding to below charged states must
be provided for the elements in the present system, otherwise Multiwfn will try to employ Gaussian
to calculate missing ones.
IA, VIIIA: -1,0,1
IIA: -1,0,1,2
IIIA, IVA, VA, VIA: -2,-1,0,1,2
VIIA: -1,0,1,2
All transition metals: -1,0,1,2

For lanthanides and actinides, the consideration of charged states is up to you. It is suggested to
consider -1, 0, 1 and 2.
As an example, if you want to calculate HI charges for water, you should provide O-2.rad, O1.rad, O_0.rad, O+1.rad, O+2.rad, H-1.rad, H_0.rad and H+1.rad in "atmrad" folder of current
directory. Generating .rad file is easy. Taking generation of O-1.rad as example, you should use
Gaussian or other code to calculate an oxygen atom with charge of -1 and spin multiplicity of 2.
Then load the resulting wavefunction file (e.g. wfn/molden/fch...) into Multiwfn, enter main
function 1000 and select subfunction 14, you will immediately obtain a .rad file with same name as
the input file.

Note that if your system contains lanthanides or actinides, this is the only way of preparing
corresponding .rad files and thus calculating HI charges.
Appendix: Two numerical algorithms of HI
Multiwfn provides below two algorithms to realize HI methods, the results are exactly the same,
they only differ by efficiency and memory requirement.
(1) Fast & large memory requirement (default): This algorithm computes as much as possible
data before starting iteration. Therefore, once initialization stage is done, the HI iteration can be
finished rapidly. The drawback of this algorithm is that large amount of memory is needed, the
memory consumed is at least 7natmnatmnradnang, where natm is the number of total atoms, nrad and
nang corresponds to the number of radial and angular integration grid per atom. Evidently, this
algorithm is unable to be applied for very large systems unless you have huge physical memory.
(2) Slow & low memory requirement: This algorithm utilizes very low amount of memory,
however, the data needed to be calculated in each iteration is much more than algorithm (1), thus
the total computational cost is much higher.
For both the two algorithms, the higher number the integration grid, the more accurate the
result. By default, nrad and nang are properly set by Multiwfn. If the system only consists of first two
rows elements, then nradnsph will be 30*170=5100. If you want to manually set nrad and nsph, you
can set "iautointgrid" in settings.ini to 0 and change "radpot" and "sphpot" parameters.
An example of computing HI charges is given in Section 4.7.4.

3.9.14 CM5 and 1.2*CM5 atomic charge (16, -16)
CM5 charge was proposed by Truhlar et al. in J. Chem. Theory Comput., 8, 527 (2012). This
charge is somewhat akin to the ADCH charge proposed by me, both of them are defined as applying
additional correction to Hirshfeld charges. Unlike ADCH, which is free of empirical parameters,
CM5 method contains global parameters as well as parameters for individual elements. The CM5
parameters are optimized for best reproduction of highly accurate experimental or theoretical
molecular dipole moment.
It is noteworthy that there is a remarkable difference between the basic feature of ADCH and
CM5: ADCH charges can exactly reproduce molecular dipole moment corresponding to present
calculation level, that means if the level used is very high (e.g. CCSD/aug-cc-pVTZ), then the dipole
moment calculated by the resulting ADCH charge must be very close to the molecular dipole
moment in real world; while if the used level is poor (e.g. HF/6-31G), then the ADCH charges will
be almost useless. In contrast, the CM5 charges do not attempt to reproduce molecular dipole
moment at present calculation level, but to reproduce real molecular dipole moment, therefore even
if low level such as B3LYP/6-31G* is used, which is certainly unable to give good dipole moment
result, the CM5 charges derived at this level commonly are still able to yield molecular dipole
moment at acceptable accuracy.
The expression of CM5 charge is

Bij = exp[ − ( rij − Ri − R j )]
where rij is distance between atom i and j, Bij may be regarded as their Pauling bond order, Ri and
Rj are their atomic covalent radii, which are defined as follows: For Z=1~96, the average between
CSD radii and Pyykkö radii are used, while for Z=97~118, the Pyykkö radii are employed. The
global parameter  equals to 2.474 Å-1. The Tij is defined as Dij if both i and j are attributed to H, C,
O, N, note that Dij=0 when i and j belong to the same element and Dij=-Dji. All the involved six Dij
parameters (H-C, H-N, H-O, C-N, C-O, N-O) are tabulated in the original paper. For other cases, Tij
is defined as Di - Dj, the optimized D parameters for all elements throughout the whole periodic
table are provided in the supplemental material of CM5 original paper.
Like usual Hirshfeld and ADCH calculations, after you enter this function, I suggest you select
option 1 to use the build-in sphericalized atomic densities in free-states, since it is the most
convenient. Then Multiwfn starts calculation of Hirshfeld charges, and then print CM5 charges. If
you want to gain detailed information about the CM5 correction process during the calculation, you
can set "ishowchgtrans" parameter in settings.ini to 1.
As demonstrated in J. Phys. Chem. B, 121, 3864 (2017), 1.2*CM5 is well-suited for molecular
dynamics with OPLS-AA forcefield. Details and calculation example can be found in Section 4.7.9.
uESE and xESE are good solvation models based on CM5 charges in gas phase, there are
corresponding codes for calculating free energy of solvation (Gsolv) based on them, see website
http://iqcc.udg.edu/~vybo/ESE/. In J. Comput. Chem., 1, 11 (2021) it was shown that uESE is much
better in average than SMD solvation model for evaluating Gsolv of ions, while xESE performs
somewhat better than SMD for evaluating Gsolv of neutral species. Multiwfn is able to generate
input file of uESE code (the input file of xESE is the same as uESE). You simply need to set
“uESEinp” in settings.ini to 1. Note that since uESE was parameterized at B3LYP/def2-TZVP level
in gas phase, the CM5 charges should also be calculated at this level, and it is advised that geometry
optimization is also performed at this level.

3.9.15 Electronegativity Equalization Method (EEM) atomic charge (17)
Theory
The EEM method is also known as Full Equalization of Orbital Electronegativity (FEOE), it
was firstly proposed in J. Am. Chem. Soc., 107, 829 (1985). The idea of EEM is very clear. The
electronegativity of atom i can be written as

 i = (  i0 +  i ) + 2(i0 + i )qi + 
j i

qj
ri. j

where 0𝑖 and 0𝑖 are Sanderson electronegativity and Parr-Pearson hardness of corresponding
element, respectively, while ∆𝑖 and ∆𝑖 are fitted parameters. qi denotes atomic charge of atom i,

3 Functions
and ri,j is distance between atoms i and j. For convenience, above formula is commonly expressed
as

 i = Ai + Bi qi +  
j i

qj
ri , j

where  is global parameter, A and B are element parameters. It can be seen that, atomic
electronegativity in a chemical system is function of atomic charges.
EEM method assumes that in a chemical system, all atoms have equal electronegativity, hence
the EEM charges can be determined by solving linear equations according to below conditions

1 =  2 = ... =  N =  mol

q = Q
i

i

where Q stands for net charge of the whole system, mol is (unknown) molecular electronegativity,
N is number of atoms.
It is easy to show that the working matrix equation for solving EEM charges can be written as
follows

Since EEM matrix element is very simple and the above matrix equation can be solved easily, EEM
charges could be evaluated rather rapidly even for very large systems.
Parameters
The result of EEM charges are directly dependent of EEM parameters , {A} and {B}. There
is no unique way to determine the parameters, the most common way to obtain them is fitting, so
that the resulting EEM charges are close to quantum chemistry atomic charges (e.g. NPA, CHELPG,
Mulliken) as much as possible. Many papers presented EEM parameters fitted to various kinds of
atomic charges calculated at different levels. In Multiwfn, below EEM parameters can be directly
chosen:
 Parameters fitted to Mulliken charges at HF/STO-3G, see Int. J. Mol. Sci., 8, 572 (2007).
Available for H, C, N, O, S
 Parameters fitted to CHELPG charges at B3LYP/6-31G* and at HF/6-31G*, see J. Comput.
Chem., 30, 1174 (2009). Available for H, C, N, O, F, S, Cl, Br, Zn
 Parameters fitted to NPA charges at B3LYP/6-311G*, they were extracted from SI of J.
Cheminform., 8, 57 (2016). Available for H, C, N, O, F, P, S, Cl, Br
Note that for some elements, their A and B parameters also depend on multiplicity, namely the
maximal formal bond order between this atom and its neighboring atoms, so that influence of
chemical environment can be taken into account.
With above mentioned parameters, EEM charges have good reproducibility of target atomic
charges for typical organic systems, but do not expect EEM method can work well for systems with

99

--- page break ---

3 Functions
complicated electronic structure, since common training set of EEM parameters only include
organic systems with typical bonding.
Usage
Since formal bond order is involved in the EEM calculation, you must use MDL molfile (.mol)
or .mol2 as input file, because in all file types that supported by Multiwfn, only this file contains
connectivity information between atoms. Do not forget that there is a severe limitation of .mol
format, namely the number of atoms cannot exceeds 999, therefore .mol2 must be used for very
large system. The .mol/.mol2 file can be outputted by many programs, such as GaussView and
OpenBabel.
After you load a .mol/.mol2 file and then enter present function, you can directly choose option
0 to calculate EEM charges, the molecular electronegativity will also be outputted together. The
default EEM parameters are those fitted for reproducing B3LYP/6-31G* CHELPG charges.
Before calculation, you can choose option "1 Choose EEM parameters", present EEM
parameters will be shown on screen, and then you can select a built-in parameter set that you want
to use. Alternatively, you can load parameters from external file using suboption 0, the format of
parameter file should mimic to this:

The first line is , after that, defining parameter for each element of each multiplicity. The second,
third and fourth columns are multiplicity, A and B, respectively. Free format is used. Using
corresponding option, the present parameters can also be exported to EEMparm.txt in current folder.
If the system under study is an ionic system, do not forget to use option "2 Set net charge" to
set net charge to actual status before calculation!
if the system contains aromatic ring(s), in order to assign suitable EEM parameters, the
aromatic ring(s) in the inputted .mol/mol2 file must be represented by alternate variation of single
and double bonds rather than represented by consecutive aromatic bonds (namely bond type 4
of .mol format, or “ar” type of .mol2 format). For this kind of system, I suggest first saving the
structure to e.g. pdb or xyz format, and then use OpenBabel to convert it to .mol format (using the
command obabel old.xyz -O new.mol2), which can then be used as input file for EEM charge
calculation, because in this case OpenBabel will automatically represent aromatic ring(s) by
alternative single and double bonds.
An example of calculating EEM charges is given in Section 4.7.5.

3.9.16 Restrained ElectroStatic Potential (RESP) atomic charge (18)
This module is quite powerful and flexible, it can calculate the standard RESP charge proposed
by Kollman and coworkers in J. Phys. Chem., 97, 10269 (1993), and can also calculate ESP fitting
charges under various equivalence and charge constraints. In Section 3.9.16.1 I first describe basic
ideas of RESP charge and related treatments, then in Section 3.19.16.2 the usage of this module is
introduced. If you are not interested in relevant theories, you can skip Section 3.9.16.1. However, if
you are not familiar with ESP fitting method, you should at least read Section 3.9.10 first to gain
minimal knowledge.
Some more discussions about this topic can be found in my blog article "Principle of RESP charge and its
calculation in Multiwfn" (in Chinese, http://sobereva.com/441).

The ESP fitting charges generated by MK and CHELPG methods introduced in Section 3.19.10
and 3.19.11 can be perfectly used for molecular modeling purpose for rigid molecules, however,
they are not quite suitable for modeling flexible molecules, due to below reasons:
(1) The results are highly dependent on conformation. Flexible molecules have many different
conformations, the conformation often changes during molecular dynamics simulation, while the
ESP fitting charges are highly sensitive to the conformation. If only one conformation is used to
calculate the ESP fitting charges and the simulation is conducted based on these charges, the
dynamic behavior of the molecule may be wrong and the relative energies between different
conformations may be seriously incorrect, since single set of fixed atomic charges is unable to
equitably well describe all relevant conformations.
(2) The atomic charges fitted at single conformation do not faithfully reflect chemical
equivalency of atoms. For example, three hydrogens on the methyl group of methanol are
chemically equivalent. During molecular dynamic simulation in room temperature, the methyl
group can rotate frequently, therefore, three hydrogens should share the same charge. However, the
calculated charges are not identical regardless of choice of conformation used in the ESP fitting
procedure (since this system does not have triple rotational symmetry along the methyl bond axis),
clearly this problem also brings some irrationality to the simulation phenomenon.
(3) The quality of fitted charge of buried atoms is poor. The ESP fitting points are distributed
in the vicinity of and outside the van der Waals surface. For atoms connected to multiple atoms
(such as sp3 hybridized carbon), especially the atoms inside a macromolecule, because of their far
distances to fitting points, their atomic charges have low fitting quality and large numerical
uncertainty. Moreover, as the conformation changes, the charge fluctuation of these buried atoms
tends to be significant, therefore the presence of these atoms further aggravate the conformational
dependence of the ESP fitting charges.
ESP fitting charges cannot be well used for modeling flexible molecules without solving above
problems.
For the above problem (1), a good solution is to simultaneously consider multiple
conformations during the ESP fitting process. One first determines the weight of each conformation,
then constructs A matrix and B vector using fitting points of various conformers with consideration
of conformational weights, then the solved ESP fitting charges can at least be able to well reproduce

the ESP of those conformations with relatively large weights. This idea has been examined in J. Am.
Chem. Soc., 114, 9075 (1992). Of course, this way of considering multiple conformations can be
very expensive for flexible molecules with many rotatable bonds, because the number
conformations increases exponentially with the increase in rotatable bonds.
For the above problem (2), equivalence constraints can be imposed on chemically equivalent
atoms in the fitting process so that their atomic charges are the same (Another way is to calculate
the ESP fitting charges as usual, and then average the charges of chemical equivalent atoms.
However, the charge obtained in this way is not as ideal as employing equivalence constraints).
For the above problem (3), the solution proposed in Kollman's RESP paper is to add a
hyperbolic penalty function

reproducibility of the ESP calculated based on wavefunction, where index A corresponds to atomic
index of non-hydrogen atoms. The penalty function involves a tightness parameter b and a restraint
strength parameter a. The former is generally set to 0.1, while the latter can be adjusted in the actual
calculation. The larger the a, the stronger the tendency of the atomic charge to be pulled down, and
meantime the worse the ESP reproducibility becomes. Obviously, the parameter a should be
properly selected, generally a value less than or equal to 0.001 is employed. It has been found that
introduction of this form of penalty function significantly lowers charges of buried atoms, while
other atoms, in particular polar atoms, are not evidently affected. Kollman believes that this
treatment also significantly reduces the conformational dependence of the ESP fitting charge. After
introducing the hyperbolic penalty function, the ESP fitting procedure can no longer be solved in
one step, iteration is needed until changes of all atomic charges are small enough.
Below I give detailed derivation of the working equation used to calculate ESP fitting charges
under above special considerations. When equivalence constraint is employed, the function to be
minimized using least square method in the ESP fitting procedure will be

zero, then updated {q'} is obtained by solving the matrix equation, after that {q'} is used to construct
the A of the second iteration. The iteration is repeated until charge variation of all atoms is smaller
than a given threshold.
The easiest way of taking multiple conformations into the ESP fitting procedure is replacing
the A matrix and B vector with their weighted averaged counterparts, as suggested in J. Am. Chem.
Soc., 114, 9075 (1992):

A =  w A 

B =  w B



where  is index of conformer and w is corresponding weight. The weights could be determined in
different ways, the common way is calculating relative Gibbs free energies and then evaluating
weights according to Boltzmann distribution.
Theory Part 2: The standard RESP charge
The Restrained ElectroStatic Potential (RESP) charge proposed by Kollman et al. in J. Phys.

3 Functions
Chem., 97, 10269 (1993) may be the most suitable atomic charge model for molecular simulation
of flexible molecules. It takes advantage of many aforementioned ideas and largely solves the above
mentioned problems in MK/CHELPG charges. The fitting process of the RESP charges is divided
into the following two steps.
• Step 1: During the charge fitting, a hyperbolic penalty function with a=0.0005 is used to
impose a weak charge restraint on non-hydrogen atoms. Charges of all atoms are fitted, and no
equivalence constraint is employed. This step allows atomic charges to change with the greatest
degree of freedom to make polar atoms fit the ESP as well as possible.
• Step 2: Using the hyperbolic penalty function with a=0.001 to impose a strong restraint on
non-hydrogen atoms. This step only allows charge of sp3 hybridized carbons, methylene carbons
and hydrogens attached on them to be fitted, while charges of all the other atoms keep fixed at the
value obtained at step 1. Equivalence constraint is applied to hydrogens on each −CH3, =CH2,
−CH2− group.
The reason why the RESP charge fitting is divided into two steps is because the authors found
that only by doing so, the problems of normal ESP fitting charges in modeling flexible molecules
could be largely solved without causing too much damage on the reproducibility of ESP. Since RESP
charge is fairly ideal for molecular dynamic modeling purpose, it has been employed by many
famous forcefields, such as AMBER, GAFF and GLYCAM.
Notice that although conformation dependency has been diminished to large extent in the subtly
designed RESP fitting process, if you want to obtain a set of atomic charges that can equally well
describe all important conformations, you still need to explicitly take multiple conformations in the
RESP fitting procedure.
The MK type of fitting points are employed in original paper of RESP, however, changing to
CHELPG type of fitting points is also completely reasonable.
Theory Part 3: ESP fitting with charge constraints
When calculating the ESP fitting charges, various constraints can be added via the Lagrangian
multiplier method. The most significant one should be constraint on net charge of specific fragments.
The charge constraints can achieve many special purposes:
(1) Biomacromolecules, polymers and other systems are all polymerized one by one. Each
component of such a macromolecule is called residue. The atomic charges of the whole system are
made up of that of individual residues. It is obvious that the net charge of each residue should be an
integer. If we want to derive atomic charges of a given residue, we can cap the two terminals of the
residue with appropriate group or fragment, and then impose charge constraint on the residue
segment during ESP fitting process so that its net charge exactly corresponds to a desired integer.
(2) Some force fields, such as GROMOS, use the charge-group concept to reduce the error of
the electrostatic interaction evaluated via cut-off method. Each charge group contains several atoms,
and all the atomic charges are summed to an integer. For example, the total charge of a carboxyl
group should be 0, and its charge should become -1 after dissociation of the proton. In order to
obtain a set of ESP fitting charges that compatible with the charge group concept, charge constraints
can be utilized to maintain the charge of each segment as a specified integer value.
(3) Sometimes one wants to calculate ESP fitting charges based on wavefunction of dimer or
multimer, and hopes that the charge of each monomer is exactly integer, this purpose could be
realized by employing charge constraints.
Technically, adapting charge constraint into ESP fitting in terms of Lagrangian multiplier is

straightforward, we only need to properly modify the form of matrix equation. For example, we
want to add below constraints:

q1 + qN = 0.5
q2 = −0.2
Then below terms should be added to the function F, which is to be minimized:

 ' (q1 + qN − 0.5) +  ' ' (q2 + 0.2 )
correspondingly, two new equations appear

F

In practical programming implementation, when multiple conformations, equivalence
constraint, charge constraint and penalty function are simultaneously taken into account, the ESP
fitting calculation is carried out in following process: Because of introduction of the hyperbolic form
of penalty function, the A and q should be updated alternately until convergence criterion is reached.
In each iteration, only the first NatomNatom block of A matrix and first Natom elements of B vector
are constructed with consideration of conformation weights and penalty function, then remainder
parts of A and B are filled according to charge constraint. Finally, according to equivalence
constraint, the corresponding rows of A are combined together (e.g. if atoms 3, 6, 7 are constrained
to be equivalent, then these three rows should be summed up) to form a temporary matrix, whose
columns are further properly combined according to equivalence constraint to form Aeqv matrix.
Similarly, the rows of B vector are transformed to Beqv according to equivalence constraint. After
that, solving the equation qeqv=Aeqv-1Beqv and correspondingly updating atomic charges according
to the given equivalency relationship. In the next cycle, the diagonal terms of A matrix are updated
using the atomic charges obtained in last cycle, while non-diagonal terms of A and all elements of
B vector are not needed to be changed. Multiwfn simply uses zero as initial charges for the atoms
to be fitted.

3.9.16.2 Usage and some details
Options in the RESP module
Any input file carrying GTF information could be used for this modules. After loading input
file and entering this RESP module (subfunction 18 of main function 7), you will find many options,
as described below
·Option 1: If you just want to calculate the standard RESP charges defined by Kollman et al.,
you should simply select this option, then the RESP charges will be calculated and printed. Since
this calculation contains two steps, it will be referred to as "two-stage RESP fitting".
·Option 2: If you simply need to calculate normal ESP fitting charges with/without specific
constraints, you should select this option. This process only includes one step, therefore it will be
referred to as "one-stage ESP fitting".
·Option -1: In the calculation of standard RESP charges and normal ESP fitting charges
with/without additional constraints, multiple conformations could be taken into the fitting process.
By selecting this option, you will be asked to input path of a plain text file containing conformer
list, each line of this file consists of file path and weight for each conformer. For example:
D:\a\conf1.fch

0.2

D:\a\conf2.fch

0.75

D:\b\conf.fch

0.05

Evidently, the sum of all weights must be exactly or very close to 1.0. After that, in the charge
calculation, all files involved in this file will be loaded and calculated in turn (if you use this feature,
the input file loaded when Multiwfn boots up will be unimportant, it can even only contain structure
information of present system, therefore you can also use e.g. .pdb and .xyz as input file).
·Option 3: By default, MK type of fitting points is employed, if you want to change to
CHELPG type of fitting points, or you want to modify detailed setting of distribution of fitting
points (such as point density), you can use this option. Note that the density of fitting points under
default setting is already high enough, thus it does not need to be further enhanced without special
reason.
·Option 4: This option is used to set parameters of hyperbolic penalty function for nonhydrogen atoms. The a used in "one-stage fitting" (0.0005 is employed by default), the respective a
parameters used in the first and second stages of the standard RESP fitting, as well as the b parameter
can be customized. Also, this option is able to manually define maximum number of RESP iterations
and convergence threshold of charge variation.
·Option 5: This option is use to set equivalence constraint. You can customize the constraint
by providing a plain text file containing entries of equivalence constraints. For example, if the file
content is
4,6,9-11
5,7

Then there will be two equivalence constraints, the first one requires that atoms 4, 6, 9, 10, 11 share
the same charge, the second one requires that atoms 5 and 7 share the same charge. The equivalence
constraint defined in this way take effect for both "one-stage fitting" and the first step of "two-stage
RESP fitting".
Note that for "one-stage fitting", by default hydrogens in each CH3 and CH2 group are
constrained to be equivalent. You can modify or simply remove this equivalence constraint setting
via this option.

106

--- page break ---

3 Functions
Suboption 10 can generate plain text file named eqvcons_H.txt containing equivalence
constraint setting of "hydrogens in each CH3 and CH2 group are the same". You can then manually
modify this file to meet your special requirement.
Subfunction 11 can generate plain text file containing equivalence constraint of symmetrically
equivalent atoms in local region or the entire system. The point group of the selected atoms will be
detected and each class of equivalent atoms will be written to eqvcons_PG.txt in current folder. This
feature is quite useful in certain cases.
·Option 6: This option is use to set charge constraint in "one-stage fitting" or the first step of
"two-stage RESP fitting" (the charge constraint does not apply to the second step, mainly because
the automatically determined equivalent constraint may conflict with user-defined charge
constraint). In this option you can provide a plain text file to customize the rule of charge constraint.
For example, if the file content is
4,6,9-11 0.8
5,7

-0.32

Then sum of charges of atoms 4, 6, 9, 10, 11 will be constrained to 0.8 during the fitting, while sum
of charges of atoms 5 and 7 will be constrained to -0.32.
·Option 7 and details about determination of connectivity: To calculate the standard RESP
charge, or to calculate the normal ESP fitting charges but requiring the charges of the hydrogens in
each CH3 and CH2 group to be equivalent, interatomic connectivity is needed for automatically
determining which atomic charges should be fitted and which hydrogens should be constrained to
be equivalent. By default, if distance between two atoms is less than 1.15 times the sum of their
CSD covalent radii, then they will be regarded as bonded. If you feel that the current connection
relationship does not match your expectation, you can select option 7 to read the connectivity from
a specific .mol file, the .mol format contains a field recording connectivity information and can be
generated by many visualization programs such as GaussView. (Alternatively, you can modify the
threshold for judging bonding in main function 0, in which you can gradually change the bonding
threshold until the bonding relationship shown in the graphical window completely in line with your
expectation, the threshold will be retained and applied to the calculation in the RESP module).
·Option 8: This option enables Multiwfn directly load fitting points and corresponding ESP
values from Gaussian output file. If you have selected this option once, then during the ESP fitting
charge calculation process, Multiwfn will no longer attempts to determine position of fitting points
and calculate ESP values, but ask you to input path of a Gaussian output file of pop=MK or
pop=CHELPG task in combination with IOp(6/33=2) keyword. In addition, Gaussian also has a
keyword IOp(6/42=x), where x is the number of fitting points per Å2 for pop=MK task. x is
recommended to set to 6, which corresponds to Multiwfn default setting. Notice that since the code
in Multiwfn and in Gaussian for generating MK fitting points is different, the result calculated with
and without loading Gaussian pop=MK output file must have slight deviation.
In general, this option is not needed, but if you prefer to perform time-consuming calculations
on server and use Multiwfn to realize analyses on a poorly configured PC, then this function will be
useful. In addition, if you may calculate ESP fitting charges for a system many times (due to some
reasons, such as each time of calculation uses a different setting), then if Gaussian output file
containing fitting points information is generated, calculation of ESP values in each time of ESP
fitting can be avoided and thus a lot of time could be saved.
• Option 9: This option is used to set additional fitting centers for the RESP fitting, which may

107

be used to enhance representation of ESP due to e.g. lone pairs and -holes. The coordinates are
read from a given text file, whose format should look like

where numdata denotes the number of additional fitting centers for each conformer (the number is
the same for all conformers). X, Y, Z denote the coordinates in Å. You can set arbitrary number of
additional fitting centers for arbitrary number of conformers. The additional center definition
between different conformers should be separated by a blank line, as illustrated above. Note that
these fitting centers are regarded as polar non-hydrogen atoms in the RESP charge fitting procedure,
however, their radii are set to zero (i.e. they do not affect number and distribution of ESP fitting
points). An example of utilizing this feature is given as "Example 6" of Section 4.7.7.
·Option 10: This option is used to set the atomic radii employed in the fitting, please check
corresponding description in the CHELPG section (Section 3.9.10) for detail. Notice that the default
mode is "automatic", in this case, if the fitting points of MK type are employed, then MK radii will
be adopted (see Section 3.9.11 on how the MK radii are defined in Multiwfn); if fitting points of
CHELPG type are employed, then CHELPG radii will be adopted.
·Option 11: This option is used to choose the type of ESP that you want to fit. Commonly,
this option should not be changed, the default type of ESP is the ESP defined in usual way. However,
if you intend to use this RESP module to derive atomic transition charges, you should choose this
option and change the ESP type to “3 Transition electronic”. Please check Section 4.A.9 for more
information and example.
More information about equivalence constraint and charge constraint
In the user-provided equivalence constraint file involved in option 5, no atom can be shared by
multiple entries. For example, if the first entry is 2~7, while the second entry is 5, 8~10, the result
will be completely meaningless, because both of them involve atom 5.
Intersection between different sets of charge constraints is allowed, for example, you can
require charge of atom 5 is 0.35 while sum of charges of atoms 3~8 is 1.0.
Charge constraint could also be used in combination with equivalence constraint; however,
there should not be intersection between any charge constraint entry and equivalence constraint
entry. For example, charges of atoms 2, 5, 9 are required to be identical, and meantime you constrain
total charge of 5, 10~15, 17~19 to be 0.15, such a combination never works since both of them
involves atom 5.
FAQ: Why sometimes spatially equivalent atoms have different charges?
You may frequently find a phenomenon that spatially equivalent atoms often have marginally
different charges. The reason is that the distribution of fitting points does not always happen to be
coincident with molecular point group. There are two ways to relieve this problem:
(1) Write an equivalence constraint file and use option 5 to load it to make the spatially

108

--- page break ---

3 Functions
equivalent atoms share exactly the same charge during fitting. Writing this file is quite easy even if
the system is large, because by subfunction 11 of option 5 you can make Multiwfn automatically
recognize point group of local fragment or the entire system and write corresponding equivalence
constraint setting to eqvcons_PG.txt. This point is fully exemplified in "Example 6" in Section 4.7.7.
(1) Choose option "3 Set method and parameters for distributing fitting points", select
CHELPG, and then select "1 Set grid spacing", input a value much smaller than the default one. The
smaller the grid spacing, the better the atomic charges satisfy the point group symmetry. This
treatment does not completely solve the problem but only relieve it, and it increases computational
cost because the number of points to be calculated is increased. Therefore, way (1) is preferred over
this way.
Many examples of evaluating standard RESP charges and normal ESP fitting charges with
various constraints, as well as some special skills can be found in Section 4.7.7.
The RESP2 method is an extension of RESP method. The RESP2 charge is more suitable than
RESP charge for molecular dynamics simulation in condensed phase since it better takes solvent
effect into account. See Section 4.7.7.9 for instance on how to calculate RESP2 charge.

3.9.17 PEOE (Partial equalization of orbital electronegativity) or
Gasteiger charge (19)
Theory
The PEOE (Partial equalization of orbital electronegativity) charge is also known as Gasteiger
charge or Gasteiger-Marsili charge, the idea was firstly proposed by Gasteiger and Marsili in
Tetrahedron Lett., 19, 3181 (1978), and then matured in Tetrahedron, 36, 3219 (1980). PEOE charge
is determined according to interatomic connectivity, chemical environment and partially based on
electronegativity equalization principle. The major advantage of PEOE method is that it is able to
estimate atomic charges for huge system with negligible computational cost. However, there are
several drawbacks in this method: (1) Only limited elements are supported (2) Actual electronic
structure is not taken into account, the charges only reflect bonding types and connectivity (3) Poor
reproducibility to many observable quantities, such as dipole moment and electrostatic potential. (4)
Cannot be used for charged systems. Despite that there are many shortcomings, PEOE is still very
popular for crude estimation of atomic charges purpose, and have been widely employed in
molecular docking and drug design fields.
The principle of PEOE method is simple. It defines atomic electronegativity as follows

 A = a + bqA + cqA2
where qA is atomic charge of atom A, while a, b and c are parameters derived by Gasteiger et al.
based on ionization potential and electron affinity of corresponding element at neutral and charge
states. The parameters are dependent of atomic hybridization state, which can be determined
according to the number and type of bonded atoms.
PEOE charges are calculated via iterative process. In every iteration, certain amount of electron

109

3 Functions
is transferred between each pair of bonded atoms. In iteration n, the variation of atomic charge of A
due to its bonded atom B is calculated as:

q (An ) = f n [  B( n −1) −  A( n −1) ] /  Aq =1

when  B( n −1)   A( n −1)

q (An ) = f n [  B( n −1) −  A( n −1) ] /  Bq =1

when  A( n −1)   B( n −1)

The f is damping factor, which is usually set to 0.5, 𝐴𝑞=1 is the electronegativity of atom A at q=1
state, clearly 𝐴𝑞=1 = 𝑎 + 𝑏 + 𝑐. However, note that, only for hydrogen, the 𝐴𝑞=1 is always equal to
20.02 eV. Since the f n term decreases swiftly with increase of iteration number n, the flow of
electrons between atoms is increasingly suppressed. In contrast to the EEM method described in
Section 3.19.5, the PEOE does not finally meet electronegativity equalization condition. The main
reason that PEOE method violates this condition is that the formula for evaluating  employed by
PEOE method is not quite rigorous, therefore damping factor must be introduced to compensate this.
Clearly, the total amount of charge variation of atom A in iteration n can be written as


 ( n −1) −  A( n −1)
 L( n −1) −  A( n −1) 
q (An ) = f n   K
+


 Aq =1
 Lq =1
L
 K

where looped atoms K and L satisfy  K( n −1)   A( n −1) and  A( n −1)   L( n −1) , respectively.
The atomic charges at iteration n are updated as

q(An ) = q(An −1) + q(An ) ,
then the atomic electronegativities {(n)} are recalculated based on {q(n)} via the aforementioned
equation.
The iteration stops when maximum of charge variation is smaller than a given threshold. In
Multiwfn the threshold is set to 0.0001, in this case the iteration can usually converge after a dozens
of cycles. In Multiwfn the f parameter is fixed to 0.5.
The initial charges, namely {q(0)}, are default to zero except for very few kinds of atoms, whose
q(0) is automatically set to a specific value. For example, the =O atom in sulfonyl group has default
q(0) of -1. Sum of all final charges is equivalent to that of all initial charges, therefore you should
guarantee that sum of all initial charges is equal to actual net charge of present system. If you want
to manually set initial charges to override the default ones, you can prepare a file named
PEOEinit.txt in current folder, each line contains atom index and initial charge, for example:
32 -0.5
33 -0.5
36 1.0

Usage
Calculating PEOE charges are quite easy. You only need to load a file containing geometry
information into Multiwfn, then enter subfunction 19 of main function 7, the determined PEOE
parameters in the current system as well as calculated charges will be printed immediately.
If you want to monitor variation in atomic charges and atomic electronegativities in each cycle,
you can set "outmedinfo" in settings.ini to 1 before booting up Multiwfn.
Currently the PEOE module of Multiwfn supports H, C, N, P, O, S, F, Cl, Br, I, most parameters
are taken from Tetrahedron, 36, 3219 (1980), while some of them are supplemented from parameter
file of the Antechamber utility in AmberTools.

3 Functions
The interatomic connectivity involved in PEOE calculation is automatically guessed according
to bond length and atomic covalent radii. If the input file is in .mol or .mol2 format, then the
connectivity will be directly load from the input file.
It is strongly encouraged to optimize the geometry at least by lowest acceptable level that can
qualitatively represent the system, so that the actual connectivity can be correctly guessed according
to bond lengths. In addition, the hybridization state of tri-coordinated nitrogen atoms is determined
by the relative position to the three atoms bonded to it, thus it is even more important to provide an
optimized geometry when the system contains nitrogens.
Charged system is not supported by PEOE method.
An example of evaluating PEOE charges is given in Section 4.7.9.

3.9.18 Minimal Basis Iterative Stockholder (MBIS) charge (20)
This method was proposed in J. Chem. Theory Comput., 12, 3894 (2016) and reviewed in J.
Phys. Chem. A, 122, 17, 4219 (2018). Like Hirshfeld-I, MBIS method refines atomic spaces by an
iteration process, however, precalculated densities of atoms in different charged states are not
needed, which makes MBIS much easier to realize. MBIS also avoids the problem that non-physical
atomic charged states may be involved in the calculation process of the Hirshfeld-I method (for
example, Hirshfeld-I charge of oxygen in MgO is more negative than -2!). For most cases, values
of MBIS charges are comparable with Hirshfeld-I charges.
Theory
In MBIS, each atom has different shells, and each shell is represented as a Slater function with
specific population and width. For example, i shell of atom A has population of NAi and width of Ai.
Population of each atom evidently equals to sum of populations of all its shells.
Reference electron density of shell Ai at a point r is expressed as
1
|𝐫 − 𝐑𝐴 |
0 (𝐫)
𝜌𝐴𝑖
= 𝑁𝐴𝑖 𝑓𝐴𝑖 (𝐫) = 𝑁𝐴𝑖 3 exp (−
)
𝜎𝐴𝑖 8𝜋
𝜎𝐴𝑖
where fAi(r) is normalized Slater function, RA is nuclear position of atom A. Reference electron
density of atom A can be straightforwardly constructed as
𝑚𝐴
0 (𝐫)
𝜌𝐴0 (𝐫) = ∑ 𝜌𝐴𝑖
𝑖=1

where mA is number of shells that atom A possesses.
𝑁𝐴𝑖 is determined as
𝑁𝐴𝑖 = ∫ 𝜌(𝐫)

0 (𝐫)
𝜌𝐴𝑖
d𝐫
𝜌0 (𝐫)

where total reference density 𝜌0 (𝐫) = ∑𝐴 𝜌𝐴0 (𝐫).
𝐴𝑖 is determined as
𝜎𝐴𝑖 =

0 (𝐫)
1
𝜌𝐴𝑖
|𝐫 − 𝐑𝐴 |d𝐫
∫ 𝜌(𝐫)
3𝑁𝐴𝑖
𝜌0 (𝐫)

Because NAi and {𝜌𝐴𝑖
} are dependent on each other, therefore they cannot be determined

directly, and iteration update is necessary. In practice, initial guess of {NAi} and {Ai} are assigned,
0
based on them the {𝜌𝐴𝑖
} and 𝜌0 are calculated, which are further used to evaluate {NAi} and {Ai}
of next iteration. MBIS atomic charges are calculated every iteration as follows
𝑚𝐴

𝑞𝐴 = 𝑍𝐴 − ∑ 𝑁𝐴𝑖
𝑖=1

If maximal change of MBIS charges is smaller than a threshold, the iteration will be ended.
The initial values of {NAi} are set to the number of electrons in each shell of the corresponding
neutral isolated atom, for example, NA1=2, NA1=8, NA1=7 for Cl atom. Regarding the initial {Ai} (in
Bohr unit), the innermost shell is 1/(2ZA), the outermost shell is 1/2. For intermediate shells, their
values are set to geometric interpolated value among the two
1
𝜎𝐴𝑖 = 1−[(𝑖−1)/(𝑚 −1)]
𝐴
2𝑍𝐴
Once MBIS iteration is finished, atomic weighting functions will be available, which may be
used in other analysis, such as calculating atomic multipole moments. The weighting function of
atom A is expressed as follows, where 𝜌𝐴0 and 𝜌0 are computed using the converged{NAi} and {Ai}
𝑤𝐴 (𝐫) = 𝜌𝐴0 (𝐫)/𝜌0 (𝐫)
Evidently, the density of present system belonging to atom A is 𝜌(𝐫)𝑤𝐴 (𝐫).
It is noteworthy that according to the definition of MBIS method, the following condition is
exactly satisfied
∫ 𝜌(𝐫)𝑤𝐴 (𝐫)d𝐫 = ∫ 𝜌𝐴0 (𝐫)d𝐫
Usage
After entering the present function (subfunction 20 of main function 7), usually you can
directly choose option 1 to start MBIS iteration, finally MBIS atomic charges are printed. Maximum
number of iterations and convergence threshold can be customized by corresponding options.
If you want to obtain values of converged {NAi} and {Ai}, you should choose option -2 to
switch its status to “Yes”. Then after MBIS calculation is finished, they will be printed.
The current code of MBIS was significantly rewritten by me based on the original code
contributed by Prof. Frank Jensen. If you hope to change to the old version, you can choose option
“-3 Enter frj implementation of MBIS code”. In the interface of old version, if you select option “4 Switch if outputting more information” to switch its status to “Yes”, then during calculation, Becke
charges, atomic/molecular dipole and quadrupole moments will also be printed. (Note that based on
current MBIS code you can also obtain atomic/molecular dipole and multipole moments. Just enter
fuzzy analysis module, use option -1 to switch to MBIS atomic space partition, then choose option
2 to conduct the analysis)
The current implementation of MBIS supports elements up to Rn, while the old version only
supports up to Ar.
