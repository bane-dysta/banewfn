It is worth to note that the precondition of using the convenient "d" mode in inputting atomic
indices is that there is no atom in the ring connecting more than two other atoms in the ring. For
example, for the naphthalene shown below, you should not enter "d" mode and input 1-10 to
calculate the AV1245 and AVmin to study the global aromaticity around the whole system, because
the atoms 9 and 10 simultaneously connect three atoms, in this case the correct atomic sequence in
the ring cannot be automatically determined by Multiwfn.

4.10 Plot density-of-states (DOS) maps
In this section, I will illustrate how to use Multiwfn to easily plot various kinds of density-ofstates (DOS) maps. The relevant theories and usage introductions of the DOS module can be found
in Section 3.12.
More in-depth discussions and DOS plotting examples can be found in my blog article "Plotting density-ofstates maps by Multiwfn to study electronic structure" (http://sobereva.com/482, in Chinese)

4.10.1 Plot total, partial and overlap DOS for N-phenylpyrrole
In this example, we will plot total, partial and overlap density-of-states (TDOS, PDOS and
OPDOS) for N-phenylpyrrole, whose structure is shown below. This example consists of six parts.
Please read Section 3.12.1 first if you are not familiar with DOS.

Because basis function information is required in plotting PDOS and OPDOS, we use .fch as

input file in these examples, using .mwfn, .molden or .gms file is also OK, but .wfn/.wfx cannot not
used, since they do not contain information of basis function and virtual MOs. If you only need to
obtain TDOS, you can also simply use a plain text file recording MO energy levels or the Gaussian
output file with pop=full keyword as input file, see Section 3.12.1 for file format.
It is noteworthy that if you intend to plot PDOS and OPDOS based on the default Mulliken orbital composition
method, employing diffuse functions must be avoided, because they severely hurt the reliability of the orbital
compositions evaluated by Mulliken or SCPA method. However, you can safely use diffuse functions if you let
Multiwfn calculate orbital composition via Hirshfeld or Becke method, but OPDOS cannot be plotted in this case.
The wavefunction of present system was generated at B3LYP/6-31G* level.

Part 1: Plot total DOS (TDOS)
Boot up Multiwfn and input below commands
examples\N-phenylpyrrole.fch
10 // Plot various kind of DOS maps
0 // Plot map
Since currently no fragment is defined, only TDOS is plotted. The TDOS map pops up
immediately, see below

In this map, the curve is the TDOS simulated based on the distribution of MO energy levels, each
discrete vertical line corresponds to a molecular orbital (MO), the dashed line highlights the position
of HOMO, the black and gray lines indicate position of occupied and unoccupied MO levels,
respectively. In the negative part, the region around -0.40 a.u. has obviously larger state density than
other regions.
Clicking mouse right button on the graph to close it, and select option 0 to return to last menu.
We can also change the energy unit and energy range, and the line height can be used to indicate
orbital degeneracy. To realize this, input below commands:
8 // Switch the unit from the default a.u. to eV
2 // Set energy range
-30,5,5 // Set lower and upper limits to -30 eV to 5 eV, the spacing between labels is 5 eV
9 // Using line height to show orbital degeneracy

Now we have below map. The line height indicates degeneracy and corresponds to the axis at
right side. As can be seen, some orbitals have degeneracy of 2.

Next, we will define the heavy atoms of pyrrole moiety as fragment 1 and that of the phenyl
moiety as fragment 2 to check their PDOS and OPDOS. In addition, we will define all hydrogens
as fragment 3.
Boot up Multiwfn and input
examples\N-phenylpyrrole.fch

-1 // Enter the interface for defining fragments. You can define up to 10 fragments. PDOS will
be plotted for all of them but OPDOS will only be drawn between fragment 1 and 2

q // Save fragment 1
2 // Define fragment 2

q // Save fragment 3

in the graph. The step between labels is set to 0.1 a.u.
0 // Draw TDOS+PDOS+OPDOS
The current graph is not very ideal. Close the graph, you can see many options used to
customize the graph, such as setting curve colors, setting legend texts. Try to play with them and if
you are confused you can consult Section 3.12.3. Here we select option 4 and input -2,9,1 to set
lower, upper limits and label interval of left Y-axis (corresponding to TDOS and PDOS) to -2.0, 9.0
and 1.0, respectively. Select 14 and input the scale factor 0.2, then range of the right Y-axis
(corresponding to OPDOS) will be set to -0.4, 1.8 (because -2.0*0.2=-0.4 and 9.0*0.2=1.8).
Shrinking the range of the Y-axis at right side is equivalent to enhancing the amplitude of OPDOS
curve, which makes the variation of OPDOS in the map clearer. Then select option 1 to replot the
DOS map, you will see

The axis at left side corresponds to TDOS and PDOS, while the one at right side corresponds
to OPDOS. The red, blue and magenta curves and discrete lines represent PDOS of fragment 1, 2
and 3, respectively. It can be seen that in most valence MOs, the fragments 1 and 2 have comparable
amount of contribution. The fragment 3 (hydrogens) mainly contributes to the MOs between -0.60
~ -0.35 a.u. Green curve is the OPDOS between fragments 1 and 2, its positive part implies that the
MOs in corresponding energy range show bonding character between the two fragments (e.g. the
one at -0.8 a.u., which corresponds to MO14); there are also regions where OPDOS is negative, e.g.
the HOMO-1 (-0.213 a.u.) behave as antibonding orbitals between the two fragments.
Part 3: Plot PDOS of a specific atom orbital
Current molecule is in YZ plane, as an example, let us check the PDOS of px atomic orbital of

Current system is calculated under 6-31G* basis set, according to the basis set definition, each
valence atomic orbital is represented by two basis functions of corresponding type. Therefore, what
we should do is to put basis functions 63 and 67 into the fragment, they collectively represent the
px orbital of nitrogen (For other kinds of basis set, you can consult Section 4.7.6 on how to identify
correspondence between basis functions and atomic orbitals). Input below commands

Part 4: Plot PDOS and OPDOS of all  molecular orbitals
This molecule is in YZ plane, assume that we only intend to study PDOS/OPDOS of π orbitals
of pyrrole and phenyl moieties and want to get rid of effect of all other MOs, although in the
fragment definition interface we can choose each PX basis function in turn, because there are too
many atoms, this process will take you a lot of time and thus is very troublesome. A much better
way is to use the condition selection command.

This time the PDOS curves only cover high-energy regions, implying that most π MOs in

From this map, it is clear that occupied frontier MOs (those close to the dash line) are solely
contributed by p orbitals.

If you want to plot PDOS for certain angular moment of orbitals for specific atoms, it is also
very easy. For example, by inputting below commands in the fragment definition interface, a
fragment corresponding to all p orbitals of all the four carbons in the pyrrole moiety could be defined.
cond // Use conditions to select basis functions
1-4 // Atoms 1~4
[Press ENTER button] // No requirement on basis function index
P // Basis function of P angular moment
Part 6: Plot PDOS based on orbital compositions derived by Hirshfeld method
Plotting PDOS requires orbital compositions. In above examples, the compositions were
evaluated using the default Mulliken method. This method is fast very, however, it is not quite robust
(especially for unoccupied orbitals), and the result is completely useless when diffuse functions are
employed. Here I also illustrate how to plot PDOS based on the orbital compositions derived by the
Hirshfeld method, which is more robust and fully compatible with diffuse functions. The
disadvantage is that Hirshfeld method is more expensive, and it can only evaluate contributions
from atoms, namely the fragments can only be defined as a set of atoms.
Here we repeat the example in "Part 2" but using compositions obtained by Hirshfeld method.
Boot up Multiwfn and input below commands:
examples\N-phenylpyrrole.fch
10 // Plotting DOS
7 // Change the method for calculating orbital compositions
3 // Hirshfeld method. Then Multiwfn calculate orbitals compositions for all atoms in all
orbitals, for large system you need to wait for a while
-1 // Define fragments
1 // Define fragment 1
1-5 // Set carbons and nitrogen of pyrrole moiety (atoms 1~5) as the fragment
2 // Define fragment 2
10-13,15,17 // Set phenyl moiety (atoms 10~13, 15 and 17) as the fragment
3 // Define fragment 3
6-9,14,16,18-20 // Set all hydrogens as the fragment
0 // Return to last menu
2 // Set X-axis
-1.1,-0.1,0.1
0 // Draw TDOS+PDOS
The resulting graph is almost identical to that plotted based on the compositions derived by the
default Mulliken method (however, the difference is often evident for the energy range composing
of unoccupied MOs, clearly the PDOS based on Hirshfeld is more reliable). Note that OPDOS
cannot be plotted when Hirshfeld method is employed to calculate orbital compositions.

4.10.2 Plot local DOS for 1,3-butadiene
If you do not know what is local DOS (LDOS), please check Section 3.12.4 first. Briefly
speaking, TDOS represents DOS curve for the whole system, PDOS describes DOS curve for an
atom (or fragment), while LDOS exhibits DOS curve for a point (i.e. space-resolved). In addition,

611

--- page break ---

4 Tutorials and Examples
we can plot LDOS for a set of point constituting a line as color-filled map, the X-axis corresponds
to energy while the Y-axis shows position in the line. LDOS is useful when interpreting the data
from scanning tunneling microscope (STM), you can find relating experimental data in e.g. J. Phys.
Chem. Lett., 5, 3701 (2014).
In the current example, we plot LDOS for butadiene at selected points. First, we plot LDOS
for the point over 1.5 Bohr of terminal carbon of butadiene. Boot up Multiwfn and input following
commands:
examples\butadiene.fch
0 // Visualize molecular structure
From output in the command-line window we can find the expected point should be 1.137 3.308
1.5 (1.5 Bohr above C1). Close the GUI window and input
10 // DOS plotting module
10 // Draw local DOS for a point
1.137,3.308,1.5
Then you will see (you can compare it with TDOS map)

Then you can see

The color in this graph represents density of states at different 3D spatial positions (Y-axis) and
different energies (X-axis). The pink arrows highlight the gaps at three different spatial positions.
If you still feel difficult in understanding meaning of the map, please check below figure, in
which some important information is explicitly labelled.

It is easy to understand, the lowermost horizontal line of the above graph (viz. the green dash
line at Y=0) corresponds to the LDOS curve map at the position of 1.5 Bohr above C1, which has
been plotted by us earlier.

4.10.3 Plot DOS map for unrestricted open-shell system: Na3O@Si12C12
In Section 4.10.1, we have plotted a closed-shell system, while in this section, I will illustrate
how to plot DOS for a typical open-shell system Na3O@Si12C12, which was studied in my work J.
Comput. Chem., 38, 1574 (2017) and is doublet. For open-shell cases calculated in unrestricted
formalism, there are two kinds of spins, they should be simultaneously taken into account, The .fchk
file can be downloaded here: http://sobereva.com/multiwfn/extrafiles/Na3O-Si12C12.rar, which
corresponds to UM06-2X/6-311G* wavefunction at optimized geometry.

Choose option 0 to return to last menu. If you want to plot the DOS map for beta spin, you
should select "6 Choose orbital spin" and then choose "2 Beta spin". If you do not want to distinguish
spin but want to take all MOs into account, you should choose "3 Both spins". Please choose beta
spin and replot the map via option 0 again, you will find the map is similar to that of alpha spin,
showing that in this system the spin polarization is not quite evident.
In order to make comparison between alpha and beta DOS maps intuitive, we can try to make
a figure, the upper part and lower part correspond to alpha spin and beta spin, respectively. Such a
map cannot be directly produced by Multiwfn, however it can be easily prepared via Multiwfn in
combination with third-part visualization software such as Origin, as shown below. The Origin
version I am using is 9.0
We first use Multiwfn to plot the alpha TDOS+PDOS map in aforementioned way, in the postprocessing menu, choose "3 Export curve and line data to plain text file in current folder". Rename

and then export the data set again, rename the DOS_curve.txt to beta.txt. The DOS_line.txt can be

Boot up Origin, drag both alpha.txt and beta.txt into it to import them. Currently, in the
workbook corresponding to beta spin, B and C columns correspond to TDOS and PDOS curve data,
respectively. We choose "Set Column Values" option for column D (which is empty currently), set
the content D to -Col(B); similarly we set column of E to -Col(C).
Next, we select proper option to plot line map. In the worksheet corresponding to alpha spin,
we add column A as X data, add columns B and C as two sets of Y data. In the worksheet
corresponding to beta spin, we add column A as X data, while add columns D and E as Y data. After
some adjustments, you will obtain below graph, which nicely exhibits DOS and PDOS for alpha
and beta spins, respectively.

In Section 3.12.5, the theory of PES and the interface for plotting PES have been introduced,
please read it if you have not. In present section, Cr3Si12- will be taken as example to illustrate how
to plot PES very easily, we will plot PES employing generalized Koopmans' theorem. This system
has been studied in J. Phys. Chem. A, 122, 9886 (2018) under PBE/6-311+G* level, it is worth to
note that the calculated first VIP of this system 2.56 eV.
Using the optimized structure of this system provided in supplemental material in the JPCA
paper, I carried out a single point task using the same level as the paper by Gaussian 16, the resulting
Cr3Si12-.fchk file can be downloaded here: http://sobereva.com/multiwfn/extrafiles/Cr3Si12-.rar.
Boot up Multiwfn and input
Cr3Si12-.fchk

namely -0.77 eV, which is the highest one among alpha HOMO and beta HOMO
3 // Set shift value to meet generalized Koopmans' theorem
1.79 // Should be 1st VIP + E(HOMO). For present case the value is -0.77+2.56=1.79 eV
4 // Set X-axis
1,4.5,0.5 // The energy span is 1.0~4.5 eV, with label step of 0.5 eV
9 // Set width of curve
10 // Make the curve thicker than default

The resulting spectrum is shown below. Note that the absolute value of Y-axis in fact is
meaningless, you can choose option "13 Toggle showing labels and ticks on Y-axis" once to switch
its status to "No" to remove the labels and ticks on the Y-axis.

that our plotting procedure and methodology are completely reasonable.

4.10.5 Plot MO-PDOS map to reveal PDOS contributed by different
MOs for cyclo[18]carbon
Note: The first published paper that came up with the idea of MO-PDOS map is my work: Carbon, 165 461
(2020), see Fig. 2. Please cite this paper if MO-PDOS map is employed in your work.

This section illustrate how to plot and analyze MO-PDOS map. The so-called "MO-PDOS"
refers to a special kind of PDOS, which is used to reveal DOS contributed by different sets of MOs
(rather than by atoms or basis functions as the PDOS in common sense), the PDOS curves and
discrete lines corresponding to different sets of MOs are shown using different colors. If requested,
the height of discrete lines can be used to reflect degeneracy of orbital levels.
We will plot MO-PDOS for cyclo[18]carbon, its structure optimized at B97XD/def2-TZVP
level is shown below, it is an exactly planar system with point group of D9h. The .fchk file of this
system corresponding to B97XD/def2-TZVP wavefunction at minimum point structure can be
download here: http://sobereva.com/multiwfn/extrafiles/C18.zip.

Occupied valence MOs of this system consist of three types, you can identify their indices by
viewing orbitals via main function 0:
(1)  MOs: 19-36
(2) in-plane  MOs: 37,39,40,45,46,49,50,53,54
(3) out-plane  MOs: 38,41,42,43,44,47,48,51,52

In this figure, the red, blue and purple discrete lines indicate position of  MOs, in-plane  MOs
and out-plane  MOs, respectively. The  ones have evidently lower energies than the  ones, while
the two kinds of  MOs have similar energy distribution. From the broadened curves, we can
identify the respective contributions due to the three types of MOs, the sum of heights of the colored
curves just equals to the black curve, which portrays the total DOS. Since the defined fragments are
only composed of occupied MOs, the unoccupied region of the map is completely identical to usual
TDOS map.
We can further improve the setting of the MO-PDOS map. After closing the graph, we input
0 // Return to last menu from the post-processing menu

From the height of the colored discrete lines, you can clearly find most occupied valence
orbitals are doubly degenerate.
Hint: Save and load status
If you want to save current status (plotting settings, fragment definition and orbital information)
of the above map to a file so that you can quickly recover the map at the next time, now you can
input 0 to exit post-processing menu, then input s, then input path of the file to save the status.
The status file corresponding to the above map is given as examples\DOS\C18_MO_PDOS.dat,
therefore if you want to directly replot the above map, after booting up Multiwfn and load the

4.10.6 Calculate d-band center for transition metal clusters
Note: Chinese version of this section with more discussions is my blog article “Using Multiwfn to calculate dband center of transition metals” (http://sobereva.com/582, in Chinese)

d-band center refers to the center position of the PDOS corresponding to d-orbitals. d-band
center of transition metals is an important quantity in explaining and predicting difference in
chemisorption strength of small molecules on transition metal systems, it is also closely related to
activity of surface catalysis, see PNAS, 108, 937 (2011) and Sci. Rep., 6, 35916 (2016) for more
information.
The DOS plotting module of Multiwfn can be used to evaluate d-band center. Since Multiwfn
automatically calculates and prints center of each PDOS curve when drawing DOS map, the d-band
center can be directly obtained by defining a fragment as all D-type of basis functions of the
transition metals of interest. In this section, I will take Cu13 (doublet) as an example to illustrate the
calculation. d-band center of this system has also been reported in J. Clust. Sci., 29, 867 (2018). The
Gaussian .fchk file of this system generated by optimization task at UPBE/Lanl2DZ level can be
directly downloaded here: http://sobereva.com/multiwfn/extrafiles/Cu13.zip. This calculation level
is the same as the J. Clust. Sci. paper.
Boot up Multiwfn and input
Cu13.fchk
10 // Plot DOS map
-1 // Define fragment
1 // Define fragment 1
cond // Define the fragment using conditions
[Press ENTER button] // No requirement on atomic indices
[Press ENTER button] // No requirement on basis function indices
D // The basis functions must be D-type
q // Save current fragment
q // Return to DOS plotting interface
8 // Switch the energy unit from a.u. to eV
2 // Set range of X-axis
-13,0,2 // Lower limit, upper limit and spacing between ticks
0 // Plot DOS map
Now you can see the following map. The red curve corresponds to PDOS of d-band

-6.510656 eV

Note: The vertical dash line corresponds to HOMO level at

-4.16932 eV

Usually d-band center is reported relative to Fermi energy level (Ef). However, Ef is not well
defined for isolated systems such as molecules and clusters, but conventionally it can be regarded
as HOMO level. Therefore, the d-band center of the Cu13 is -6.510656-(-4.16932) = -2.34 eV, which
is in very good agreement with the -2.33 eV reported in Table 3 of J. Clust. Sci., 29, 867 (2018).
Note that for unrestricted open-shell wavefunction like this example, d-band center is different
for alpha and beta spins. By default only alpha orbitals are taken into account, if you need to
calculate it for beta orbitals, you should choose option "6 Choose orbital spin" and select beta.
The choice of range of X-axis is a matter of concern. The formula of calculating center of
PDOS can be found in Section 3.21.1, it can be seen that only the segment of PDOS in present
energy range (range of X-axis) is taken into account, namely the PDOS between -13 and 0 eV is
involved in the calculation of d-band center. Clearly, different choices of energy range may result
in different d-band center values. You must guarantee that the current energy range fully encloses
the actual PDOS region of d-band. The lower limit is relatively arbitrary, because the PDOS is
exactly zero below -13 eV, decreasing the lower limit will not influence the center position. The
choice of upper limit is more critical, without special situation I suggest simply set it to zero like
the present example. The upper limit should not be set to a very high value, otherwise the PDOS
lacking of chemical significance will be included in the calculation. For example, if you set lower
and upper limits to -20 and 60 eV, respectively, the PDOS will be

As can be seen, the PDOS of the fragment corresponding to D-type basis functions is also very large
between 15~40 eV, and the reported center position is even an unphysical positive value. This
phenomenon comes from the fact that Lanl2DZ is an extended basis set, each d atomic orbital of Cu
is represented by two basis functions. The high-lying part of the PDOS essentially corresponds to
the MOs orthogonal to the valence d orbitals approximately within the range of -13~0 eV.
Similarly, the p-band center can also be calculated in an analogous way.

4.10.7 Plot COHP for C60 fullerene and N-phenylpyrrole
Please read Section 3.12.6 first if you are not familiar with COHP. In this section, we first plot
COHP between nearest atoms for C60 fullerene, and then plot COHP between two moieties for Nphenylpyrrole.
Example 1: C60 fullerene
The used wavefunction file C60.fch produced at B3LYP/6-31G* level can be downloaded at
http://sobereva.com/multiwfn/extrafiles/C60.zip.
Boot up Multiwfn and input

Now will see COHP map on screen. Close the map, adjust left and right Y-axes by options 4
and -4 in post-processing menu, respectively, and then replot, you will see the following map, which

corresponds to Fig. S17 of Multiwfn original paper J. Chem. Phys., 161, 082503 (2024).

The right Y-axis corresponds to the height of the spikes, and the left axis corresponds to the
curve broadened from the spikes. Note that the two Y-axes correspond to negative of COHP (-COHP)
rather than COHP. In this map, all MOs contribute positively to the curve are the so-called bonding
states, whose occupation stabilizes the system. In contrast, all MOs contribute negatively to the
curve are antibonding states, whose occupation reduce overall bonding effect and thus destabilize
the C60. The dash line in the map highlights the HOMO, it can be seen that most occupied MOs
belong to bonding state, certainly C60 can exist stably.
Example 2: N-phenylpyrrole
In Part 4 of Section 4.10.1, we have plotted OPDOS to study -interaction between the pyrrole
and phenyl moieties in N-phenylpyrrole. In this section, with exactly the same definition of
fragments, we plot interfragment COHP map.
