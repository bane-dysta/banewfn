Now you can see the following map, which is quite similar to the corresponding OPDOS curve
plotted in Part 4 of Section 4.10.1. This example shows that COHP usually convey analogous
information like OPDOS.

4.11 Plot various kinds of spectra
Note: Most examples in this section are also available in my blog article “Using Multiwfn to calculate transition
electric dipole moment between excited states and electric dipole moment of each excited state”
(http://sobereva.com/224, in Chinese), which also contains extended discussion.

Multiwfn has a very powerful and flexible spectrum plotting module. The basic principles,
supported input files and all options of this module have been detailedly introduced in Section 3.13.
In the next sections I will briefly exemplify the usage of this module. If you are not familiar with
related theories, please carefully read Section 3.13.1 first.
It is worth to note that there is also an article of introducing detailed steps on how to simulate
UV-Vis and ECD spectra using Multiwfn in combination with ORCA, see http://sobereva.com/485.

4.11.1 Plot infrared (IR) spectrum for NH3BF3
This example plots infrared (IR) spectrum for NH3BF3. Multiwfn can read in frequencies and
intensities from output file of Gaussian or ORCA vibration analysis task (“freq” keywords). Boot
up Multiwfn and input following commands

The left axis corresponds to curve (broadened data), the right axis corresponds to discrete lines
(original transition data). Plotting parameters such as full width at half maximum (FWHM),
broadening function, unit and range of the axes can be adjusted by corresponding options in the
interface. The graph and X-Y data set of discrete lines/curve can be exported by option 1 and 2,
respectively.
Note that after selecting option 0 to plot the spectrum, Multiwfn prints extrema information in
the console window

From this output you can obtain accurate position and height of absorption peaks. As will be
illustrated in Section 4.11.3, the maxima and minima can even be directly labelled on the spectrum.
It is well known that the frequencies produced under harmonic approximation deviate to
experimental vibrational frequencies systematically. In order to correct this problem, fundamental
frequency scale factor should be applied, this can be done easily in Multiwfn. We close the spectrum
and then choose "14 Set scale factor for vibrational frequencies ", then press ENTER button directly
to choose all vibrational modes, then press ENTER button directly again to employ the scale factor
fitted for B3LYP/6-31G* level, namely 0.9614, which can be found in Table 1 of J. Phys. Chem.,

100, 16502 (1996). After that, if you replot the spectrum, the resulting spectrum will correspond the
scaled one.
Note: You can apply different scale factors for different vibrational modes. After applying a scale factor for a
batch of modes, you can enter option 14 again, Multiwfn will ask you if restoring all vibrational frequencies to the
original ones. If you input n, then you can input a different scale factor for another batch of modes, the effect will be
superimposed.

Some experimental IR spectra determine transmittance rather than absorption. To mimic this
kind of spectrum, you can select "4 Set left Y-axis" and then input e.g. 6000,0,400 to set lower limit,
upper limit and label interval to corresponding values, respectively, and then input y to automatically
scale the right Y-axis. Since currently lower limit (0) is higher than upper limit (6000), the Y-axis is
inverted.
The procedure of plotting Raman, UV-Vis, electronic/vibrational circular dichroism
(ECD/VCD), ROA spectra is very similar to plotting IR spectrum, you only need to use proper input
file and select corresponding option after entering main function 11. If the quantum chemistry
program you used for spectrum calculation is not the one directly supported by Multiwfn, you can
manually extract data from corresponding output file and then write them into a plain text file
according to the format shown in Section 3.13.2, then the file can be used as input file of Multiwfn
for plotting spectrum.

4.11.2 Plot UV-Vis spectrum and contributions from individual
transitions for acetic acid
The spectrum plotting module of Multiwfn is quite flexible, not only the total spectrum but
also the contribution from individual transitions can be exported. This feature is particularly useful
when you want to identify nature of spectrum. In this section I will show how to realize this analysis,
UV-Vis spectrum of acetic acid is taken as example.
Boot up Multiwfn and input
examples\spectra\acetic_acid_TDDFT.out // Calculated at TD-B3LYP/cc-pVDZ level by
Gaussian
11 // Plot spectrum
3 // The type of the spectrum is UV-Vis
15 // Output the spectrum including the contributions from certain individual transitions
0.01 // The criterion of selecting transitions is oscillator strength > 0.01
The curve of the UV-Vis spectrum together with the contributions from the transitions whose
absolute value of strength are larger than 0.01 have been outputted to spectrum_curve.txt in current
folder. The first two columns correspond to energies and molar absorption coefficients, the
correspondence between the other columns and transition modes are clearly indicated on screen:
Column#

Transition#

3

2

//i.e. transition S0→S2

4

3

//i.e. transition S0→S3

5

5

//i.e. transition S0→S5

6

11

//i.e. transition S0→S11

7

13

//i.e. transition S0→S13

The discrete line data are outputted to spectrum_line.txt in current folder.
Now you can plot the data in the two files as curves in a single graph by your favourite program

(if you use Origin to plot, you can directly drag these two files into Origin window to import them).
In the two files, the first column should be taken as X-axis data, while the other columns should be
taken as Y-axis data. The spectrum plotted by Origin is shown below, if you are confused about the
procedure, you can consult the acetic_acid_TDDFT.opj provided in "examples\spectra" folder,
which is the .opj file of Origin 8.

Wavelength (nm)

From the graph the underlying character of the total UV-Vis spectrum (black curve) is now
very clear. Although the S0→S3 transition (146.28nm) does not has very small oscillator strength
(0.036), no absorption peak directly corresponds to this transition, since its absorption curve (blue
curve) has been completely merged into the neighboring large absorption peak due to S0→S5
transition (cyan curve).
As mentioned in last section, after selecting option 0 to plot spectrum, Multiwfn directly prints
extrema of the spectrum curve. In current case the outputted data is

Based on above outputs, we can calculate the contributions from different transitions to a given
peak. For example, we want to study the composition of the peak at 138.0728 nm. In
spectrum_curve.txt, move to the line corresponding to 138.07278 nm, you can find the total value
is 4667.79439, while the values in column 4 and 5 are 309.47267 and 4273.59757, respectively.
Therefore, the contribution from S0→S3 and S0→S5 can be respectively calculated as
309.47267/4667.79439100% = 6.63% and 4273.59757/4667.79439100% = 91.55%.
In Multiwfn one can very easily obtain major contributions from various transitions to a given
wavelength. For example, we want to understand the transitions having maximal contribution to the

maximum 3 (138.0728 nm), so we input
15 // Output contributions of individual transitions to the spectrum
0 // Calculate maximal 10 contributions to a given position
138.0728 // The position of interest
You will see
Sum of absolute values of all transitions:

4667.79444

The individual terms are ranked by magnitude of contribution:

It is clearly seen that S0→S5 contributes most to the maximum (91.5%), while S0→S3 plays
an unimportant but nonnegligible role (contributes 6.6%).

4.11.3 Plot electronic circular dichroism (ECD) spectrum for
asparagine
In this example we plot electronic circular dichroism (ECD) spectrum for asparagine. Boot up
Multiwfn and input
examples\spectra\Asn_TDDFT.out // Gaussian TDDFT task at PBE0/6-311G* level, 30 lowest
excited states were calculated
11 // Plot spectrum
4 // ECD
2 // Read the rotatory strengths in velocity representation
0 // Show the spectrum
From the resulting spectrum, you will find the labels of X-axis and Y-axis are decimal. In order
to make the graph more beautiful, it is suggested to modify the scale so that label of each tick is
integer. Therefore, we close current graph and input below commands:
3 // Set X-axis
120,280,20 // Lower and upper limits, as well as spacing between ticks of X-axis
4 // Set left Y-axis
-90,100,20 // Lower and upper limits, as well as spacing between ticks of left Y-axis
y // Let program properly adjust right Y-axis to guarantee that zero point of left and right axes
are in the same horizontal line
0 // Show the spectrum
Then you will see below graph

Note that you can use exactly the same way as that illustrated in Section 4.11.2 to decompose
the total ECD spectrum to individual contribution from each transition.
As can be seen from the above spectrum, the unit of  at left axis is labelled as arb., which
means “arbitrary unit”. Only curve shape of ECD is of interest, this is why arb. is and should be
used in this situation.
Labelling minima and maxima labels on spectrum
One of the strengths of Multiwfn in plotting spectrum is that maxima, minima or both can be
directly labelled on the spectrum. To label wavelength of both maxima and minima, we input
16 // Enter the interface of setting status of showing labels of spectrum minima and maxima
1 // Change displaying status of labels
3 // Label both maxima and minima on the spectrum
0 // Return
4 // Set left Y-axis
-100,110,20 // Making range of left Y-axis slightly wider, because the labels will be shown
y // Correspondingly scale right Y-axis
0 // Plot spectrum again
Now you can see below map

Hint: Save and load plotting settings
In order to replot the above map quickly in the future, I suggest saving plotting settings to a
file, namely input below commands:
s // Save plotting settings
Asn_ECD.dat // Save settings to Asn_ECD.dat in current folder
Next time, if you want to recover the above map, you simply need to input
examples\spectra\Asn_TDDFT.out
11 // Plot spectrum
4 // ECD
2 // Read the rotatory strengths in velocity representation
l // Load plotting settings
Asn_ECD.dat // Save settings to Asn_ECD.dat in current folder
0 // Plot the spectrum
Note that the Asn_ECD.dat corresponding to the above map has already been provided in

4.11.4 Plot conformational weighted UV-Vis and ECD spectra for
plumericin
Note: Chinese version of this section is my blog article “Using Multiwfn to plot conformationally averaged
spectrum” (http://sobereva.com/383).

For a flexible system with many thermally accessible conformation (or configurations), when
plotting its spectrum, it is crucial to take weighting average of various conformations into account,
otherwise the resulting spectrum is impossible to be compared well with experimental spectrum.
Fortunately, weighted spectrum can be very conveniently plotted by Multiwfn, I will show how to
do this in present section. Plotting conformational weighted UV-Vis and ECD spectra of plumericin

are taken as instances.
Preparation
Before calculating conformational weighted spectrum, we need to evaluate population of these
conformations, commonly Boltzmann's weight is used. We assume that plumericin has four
accessible conformations, and properly construct their initial geometries, then optimize them and
perform frequency analysis at B3LYP/6-31G* level with zero-point energy scale factor of 0.9806.
Based on optimized geometries, high-accuracy single point energies at M06-2X/def2-TZVP level
were calculated. Finally, we add the Gibbs thermal corrections produced by frequency analysis to
the single point energies to yield relatively accurate Gibbs energy of various conformations. After
that, according to Boltzmann's formula and relative Gibbs energy among these conformations, we
calculate their weights at 298.15 K. Then, using TD-PBE0/TZVP level we calculate the lowest 20
excited states for these conformations. The output file of the TDDFT tasks have been provided in
"examples\spectra\weighted" folder as a.out, b.out, c.out and d.out (the names are arbitrary, you can
also use other file names).
Now we write a plain text file named multiple.txt with below content (the name should not be
changed, but prefix may be added, such as plumericin_multiple.txt):
examples\spectra\weighted\a.out 0.6046
examples\spectra\weighted\b.out 0.1950
examples\spectra\weighted\c.out 0.1686
examples\spectra\weighted\d.out 0.0317

As can be seen, in the multiple.txt, each line contains path of output file of a conformation
followed by its Boltzmann weight we calculated above. Hereinafter, the four conformations will be
referred to as a, b, c and d, respectively.
PS: If you are using Linux system, and there are / symbols or space in the path, do not forget to add double
quotation marks at the two ends of the path, otherwise Multiwfn cannot recognize the file path, for example:
"examples/spectra/weighted/a.out" 0.6046
"examples/spectra/weighted/b.out" 0.1950
"examples/spectra/weighted/c.out" 0.1686
"examples/spectra/weighted/d.out" 0.0317

Plot conformational weighted UV-Vis spectrum
Boot up Multiwfn and input

The thick red curve corresponds to conformational weighted UV-Vis spectrum, while the green,
blue, purple and black curves correspond to UV-Vis spectrum of conformation a, b, c and d,
respectively. The weight of each conformation is also shown in the legend. From this graph the we
can very conveniently compare the character of weighted spectrum and spectra of individual
conformations.
The black discrete lines on the graph represent all transition data of the four conformations,
their heights have already been scaled by conformational weight. Hence, the thick red curve can be
regarded as broadened by all discrete lines shown on the graph.
Multiwfn provides another mode to plot spectrum of individual conformations. We close above
graph and choose "18 Toggle weighting spectrum of each system" once, then choose option 0 to
view the spectrum again, we will see

The spectrum curve of each conformation shown on this graph has already been multiplied by
corresponding weight. Obviously, what this graph represents is contribution of each conformation
to the conformational weighted spectrum. In other words, the height of thick red curve is simply the
sum of height of all other curves. It can be seen that conformation a (green line) has major
contribution to the conformational weighted spectrum, their profiles are rather similar, this is
because a has as high as 60.5% population.
The discrete lines in above graph now have different colors, the color correspond to legend
shown at right-top side. For each conformation, since both discrete lines and curve currently have
identical color, we can say for example, green curve can be directly yielded by broadening the green
discrete lines.
Plot conformational weighted ECD spectrum
Using the same procedure illustrated in the last section, we plot conformational weighted ECD
spectrum and ECD spectrum for all the four conformations.
Boot up Multiwfn and input

This graph decomposes the final weighted ECD spectrum to contribution of individual conformation.
Again, since conformation a (green) has very high population and thus dominates the final weighted
curve, most characters of these two curves are similar. However, influence from other conformations
cannot be simply ignored. From the graph it is easy to find that if conformation c (purple) is missing,
then there will not be an evident ECD peak at approximately 180 nm, since only ECD of c at this
wavelength has significant signal.

4.11.5 Plot Raman and pre-resonance spectra for 2-methyloxirane
The procedure of plotting Raman spectrum is very similar with plotting IR spectrum, the only
additional step you would better do is to convert the Raman activities directly outputted by Raman
task of quantum chemistry codes to Raman intensities before plotting the spectrum, so that the
resulting spectrum can be comparable with the experimental one. The Raman intensities are
dependent of wavelength of incident light source and ambient temperature, while Raman activities
are not. This point has been emphasized in Section 3.13.1. In this section, I illustrate how to properly
plot Raman spectrum using (2S)-2-methyloxirane as example.
Boot up Multiwfn and input
examples\spectra\2-methyloxirane_Raman.out // Output file of Raman task calculated at
B3LYP/6-31G* level by Gaussian09
11 // Plot spectrum
2 // Raman spectrum
14 // Apply frequency scale factor
[Press ENTER button] // Select all frequencies

Multiwfn can also plot pre-resonance Raman spectrum. An example output file of preresonance Raman task of Gaussian is examples\spectra\2-methyloxirane_Raman.out, the
corresponding input file (.gjf) is also given. This task calculates Raman activity at incident
wavelength of 150 nm and 140 nm, which are close to S0→S1 and S0→S2 TDDFT excitation
energies at the same calculation level (147.36 nm and 138.81 nm at TD-B3LYP/6-31G* level,
respectively). You can load this output file into Multiwfn and plot Raman spectrum as usual. The
only difference is that, before entering spectrum plotting interface, Multiwfn asks you to choose the
incident frequency for which the Raman activities will be loaded. If you choose 2 or 3, the spectrum
you finally obtained will be pre-resonance Raman at corresponding frequency; if you choose " 1:
0.00000000", namely the static limit case, the resulting spectrum will be exactly identical to the one
we obtained earlier.

4.11.6 Simultaneously plot multiple systems
In Multiwfn, it is very easy to plot spectrum for multiple systems simultaneously, these systems
may correspond to different conformations, different configurations, different molecules or different
calculation conditions. In this section two examples are provided.
Comparing spectra yielded by different theoretical methods and basis sets
In "examples\spectra\indigo" folder, you can find Gaussian output file of electronic excited
state task carried out at different levels. In this example, we plot them together so that their results
can be conveniently compared.
What we need to do first is to prepare a file named multiple.txt including path of various
systems with their legends, this file has been provided as examples\spectra\indigo\multiple.txt, its

content is:

examples\spectra\indigo\TD-PBE0.out TD-PBE0/6-31G*
examples\spectra\indigo\TD-PBE0_TZVP.out TD-PBE0/def-TZVP

Note that the legends must not simply be a digital, otherwise it will be interpreted as weight of
corresponding system (see Section 4.11.4). In addition, in Linux system, if the file path contains /
symbol, do not forget to add double quotation marks at the two ends of the path.
Boot up Multiwfn, load multiple.txt and then plot UV-Vis spectrum as usual, you will see below

From the graph it is clear that basis set only has small influence on the resulting spectrum,
while the spectrum profile of ZINDO differs from that of TD-PBE0 significantly. The curve of all
systems may be exported via option 2 as curveall.txt and then replotted via third-part program such
as Origin.
In "examples\spectra\indigo" folder you can also find ZINDO_30.out, it corresponds to a
ZINDO calculation with 30 excited states produced. You can also include it into multiple.txt.
Comparing spectra with and without spin-orbit coupling effect
ORCA program is able to take spin-orbit coupling (SOC) effect into account during TDDFT
calculation, here we plot and compare the UV-Vis spectrum with and without the SOC consideration.
Please download http://sobereva.com/multiwfn/extrafiles/SOC-TDDFT_ORCA.zip, it is an ORCA
output file of TDDFT task for Ir(ppy)3 coordinate, SOC treatment had been enabled in the
calculation via dosoc true keyword in the %tddft field. In the output information, there are excitation
energies and oscillator strengths before and after SOC correction.
Extract the .zip package, put the .out file in current folder, then create a multiple.txt with below
content

Ir_ppy3.out without SOC

Boot up Multiwfn and input

you will obtain below graph. Clearly, SOC effect has non-negligible influence on the spectrum for
present systems.

It is worth to note that the number of states with SOC is by far larger than that without SOC.
Because SOC effect splits each originally degenerate triplet state to three sublevels. For example,
assume that the TDDFT calculates 50 singlets and 50 triplets, then after taking SOC correction into
account, there will be 50+3*50=200 states. Since the number of states corresponding to SOCTDDFT is higher than that corresponding to regular TDDFT, when two (or more) set of data are
simulated as theoretical spectra, the first legend in multiple.txt must correspond to SOC-TDDFT
case, and when loading data for the first spectrum, you must choose y to let Multiwfn load SOC
corrected TDDFT data, as I illustrated above.

4.11.7 Plot VCD and ROA spectra for chiral molecule S-methyloxirane
Vibrational circular dichroism (VCD) and Raman optical activity (ROA) are important types
of vibrational spectra for chiral molecule, and only chiral molecule has VCD and ROA signals, see
Section 3.21 for detail. In this example, I will illustrate how to plot these spectra for a typical chiral
molecule S-methyloxirane.
Plotting VCD spectrum
The corresponding Gaussian input and output files are S-methyloxirane_VCD.gjf and Smethyloxirane_VCD.out in examples\spectra folder, respectively. As you can see, freq=VCD
keyword was used and the calculation is at B3LYP/6-31G* level.

The right axis corresponds to the heights of the spikes, which represent rotatory strengths. The
left axis corresponds to the broadened VCD curve from the spikes, which represent difference in
absorption of left- and right-circularly polarized lights. The "arb." denotes that the unit is arbitrary,
because the absolute magnitude is not chemically interesting.
Plotting ROA spectrum
This plotting is based on output file of Gaussian freq=ROA task. The Gaussian input and output
files are S-methyloxirane_ROA.gjf and S-methyloxirane_ROA.out in examples\spectra folder,
respectively. As can be seen from the input file, this calculation takes three incident light frequencies
(500, 532 and 600 nm) into account. It is well-known that diffuse functions are important for
obtaining accurate ROA data, so aug-cc-pVDZ is used here.
Boot up Multiwfn and input

If you intend to use this spectrum in a publication, I suggest removing the labels in both the
left and right ordinates, since the absolute values are meaningless, only the shape of the curve is of
chemical significance. To do so, choose "17 Other plotting settings" and then choose suboptions 2
and 3, you will find the labels are disappeared when you replot the spectrum.

4.11.8 Skill: Plot spectrum for a batch of files via shell script
Note: There is an illustration video corresponding to this section: https://youtu.be/x6jp40DR24k.
In this section, I show how to plot spectrum for a batch of input files via shell script. Via this
way, all input files in current folder can be immediately converted to respective spectrum image file
by only one command!
Assume you are using Windows system, and you want to convert all Gaussian TDDFT .out file
in examples\spectra\indigo folder to UV-Vis spectrum, what you should do is:
• Copy the .out files to Multiwfn folder
• Copy examples\spectra\UV-Vis.txt and examples\spectra\batchspec.bat to Multiwfn folder
• Set "isilent" in settings.ini to 1 and save the file

640

--- page break ---

4 Tutorials and Examples
• Double-clicking the batchspec.bat
Now the batch script invokes Multiwfn to process all .out files in current folder according to
the commands in the UV-Vis.txt. After a few seconds, you will find all spectrum image files have
been generated in current folder, the name is identical to the .out file.
If you want to plot IR spectrum for a batch of files in current folder, copy
examples\spectra\IR.txt to current folder and replace the "UV-Vis.txt" in the .bat script with "IR.txt",
then run the .bat file.
The content of UV-Vis.txt and IR.txt is very easy to understand if you already know how to run
Multiwfn in silent mode and batch mode. If you have not read Sections 5.2 and 5.3, after reading
them you will fully understand how the script works. Commonly, you should properly modify the
settings (range of axes) in the .txt file before employing it for producing spectrum for your systems.
Via the same way, you can also use Multiwfn to plot other kinds of spectra for a batch of input
files, you need to manually compile the .txt file containing proper commands.
In Linux environment, you can also use shell script to realizing the batch plotting. The
examples\spectra\batchspec.sh is a Bash script that have exactly identical function as the
batchspec.bat shown above.

4.11.9 Skill: Use spikes to indicate position of transition levels
In Multiwfn, it is possible to plot a set of spikes at the bottom of the simulated spectrum to
highlight position of specific transition levels. In Section 4.11.1 we have plotted IR spectrum for
NH3BF3, which has some featured vibration modes. This time we will use spikes with different
colors to highlight position of two kinds of modes on the map: (1) stretching vibration of B-N bond
(2) stretching vibration of N-H bonds. The index of these modes can be identified by inspecting
vibration animations in GaussView.
Boot up Multiwfn and input below commands
examples\spectra\NH3BF3_freq.out
11 // Plot spectrum
1 // The type of the spectrum is IR
23 // Set status of showing spikes to indicate transition levels
1 // Set the first set of spikes. We want to use black spikes to reveal all vibrations
a // Select all modes
5 // Black
2 // Set the second set of spikes
16-18 // Indices of stretching vibration mode of the three N-H bonds
1 // Red
3 // Set the third set of spikes
4 // Index of vibration mode of B-N bond stretching
2 // Green
0 // Return
4 // Modify Y-axis at left side
0,6000,600 // Set lower and upper limits as well as label spacing
y // Correspondingly scale Y-axis at right side
0 // Plot the graph

641

--- page break ---

4 Tutorials and Examples
You will see below map

The red spikes in this graph clearly indicate that the N-H stretching modes have highest
frequencies, while the B-N stretching vibration mode (green spike) has frequency about 400 cm-1.
All other vibration modes are highlighted by black spikes.
It is worth to note that although the first set of spike is black and contains all vibration modes, the second and
third sets of spikes are plotted after it, therefore the N-H and B-N stretching vibration modes are in red and green
colors respectively rather than in black.

Properly using the spikes to indicate featured transitions can make the graph much more
informative. For example, when you plot UV-Vis map, you can use spikes in different colors to
distinguish different transition types (e.g. →* and n→*, or local excitation and charge transfer
excitation).
If some transitions are degenerate, you can enable Multiwfn to exhibit degeneracy in terms of
spike height. To do so, after defining spikes in option 23, choose its suboption "-3 Toggle
considering degenerate" and input a threshold for determining degeneracy. If energy span over two
or more transitions is less than the threshold, then they will be regarded as degenerate, only the
lowest lying one will be drawn as spike with height of degenerate degree, while other ones will be
invisible. For example, below is IR spectrum of cyclo[18]carbon, the green and blue spikes reveal
position of in-plane and out-plane vibration transitions, respectively. Most transitions have
degeneracy of two (full height), while a few are not degenerate and thus the spike height is only
half.

4.11.10 Plotting NMR spectrum
Note: Chinese version of this section is my blog article “Using Multiwfn to plot NMR spectra”
(http://sobereva.com/565), which also contains extended discussions.

Please read Section 3.13.5 first to gain basic knowledge about the module of plotting NMR
spectrum. In this section, a few examples will be given to show how to easily and flexibly plot NMR
spectrum in Multiwfn.

4.11.10.1 Plotting 1H and 13C NMR spectra for acetaldehyde
In this example we plot 1H and 13C NMR spectra for acetaldehyde, which is shown below.

examples\spectra\NMR\Acetaldehyde.out is output file of NMR task of Gaussian 09. The
geometry was optimized using B3LYP/def2-SVP level in vacuum, while the NMR task was
conducted at B97-2/def2-TZVP level under chloroform environment represented by SMD solvation
model. It was demonstrated that B97-2 is a good choice for theoretically evaluating NMR, at least
for 1H and 13C, see J. Chem. Theory Comput., 10, 572 (2014) for benchmark. The NMR output file
of
tetramethylsilane
(TMS)
calculated
at
the
same
calculation
level
is
examples\spectra\NMR\TMS.out, as can be seen from line 355 and line 360, the isotropic magnetic
shielding value of C and H are 186.8707 and 31.5143 ppm, respectively, they will be taken as
reference values later.
We first plot 13C NMR spectrum. Boot up Multiwfn and input

7 // NMR
From option 6 in the interface, you can find the element currently considered is carbon. Now
if you directly select option 0, you will see 13C spectrum, however, the X-axis corresponds to
absolute shielding value. In order to make X-axis correspond to chemical shift, we should input
7 // Set how to determine chemical shifts
1 // Using reference shielding value to derive chemical shifts
186.8707 // Reference value of carbon in TMS (see above). Since this value is a built-in data,
in this step you can also directly input a to employ it
0 // Plot NMR spectrum
Now you can see

In the above map, the height of black spikes corresponds to the "Degeneracy" axis, while red
curves are broadened from the spikes, their values correspond to the "signal strength" axis. The blue
texts indicate the index of the atom corresponding to the peak.
You can also see following information on Multiwfn console window
Term:

1

Chemical shift:

29.657 ppm

Atom:

1(C )

Term:

2

Chemical shift:

In the NMR plotting interface, there are many options used to adjust various plotting settings,
such as range of X and Y axes, style of atom labels, color and thickness of spikes and curves, FWHM
parameter of broadening and so on, please play with them to improve the spectrum according to
your actual requirement.
Next, we plot 1H NMR spectrum. Input below commands
6 // Choose the element considered in plotting
H // Hydrogen
7 // Set how to determine chemical shifts
1 // Using reference shielding value to derive chemical shifts
a // As mentioned above, this input corresponds to using built-in reference data of TMS

evaluated at B97-2/def2-TZVP level under chloroform
It is important to notice that the shielding values of the three hydrogens in the methyl group
must be averaged, since methyl group rotates easily in actual environment and thus there is only one
NMR peak of hydrogens in this group. Thus we input
10 // Average shielding values of specific atoms
2-4 // H2, H3 and H4 are the hydrogens in the methyl group
0 // Plot the spectrum
Now you can see

As you can see, the plotting effect is fairly satisfactory. The information currently shown in

4.11.10.2 Plotting NMR spectra for pyridine based on scaling method
As introduced in Section 3.13.5, there is another way of determining chemical shifts of 1H and
13C, namely scaling method. Via this method we do not need to calculate reference values, and good
chemical shifts could be obtained even using inexpensive calculation levels since the prefitted
scaling parameters eliminated most systematical errors. In this section we plot NMR spectrum for
pyridine based on the scaling method. examples\spectra\NMR\pyridine_scale.out is output file of
NMR task of Gaussian calculated at B3LYP/6-31G* level with chloroform environment represented
by SMD solvation model, while the geometry was optimized at B3LYP/6-31G* level in vacuum.
The error statistics of various levels given in http://cheshirenmr.info indicate that this level is one
of best levels of applying scaling method.
Boot up Multiwfn and input

Now you can see

Due to symmetry of pyridine, there are two peaks showing double degenerate character.
Similarly, you can plot 1H NMR spectrum via scaling method, namely input
6 // Choose the element considered in plotting

0 // Plot the spectrum

4.11.10.3 Plotting conformation weighted NMR spectrum for valine
In this section, I will illustrate how to plot conformation weighted NMR spectrum. Valine is an
essential amino acid, it has two conformers in aqueous environment, as show below. The values in
the parentheses are my theoretically estimated conformation weights in water.

646

--- page break ---

4 Tutorials and Examples
In this section we will simulate 1H NMR spectrum of valine in water and compare it with
experimental spectrum measured in D2O solvent. Note that since the three hydrogens in the
protonated amino group are fully substituted by deuterium in heavy water environment, we need to
eliminate its contribution from the spectrum. Also, we need to average shielding values of the

The conf1.out and conf2.out in "examples\spectra\NMR\valine" folder are output files of NMR
task of Gaussian 16, the NMR calculations were conducted at B97-2/def2-TZVP level, the
geometries were optimized at B3LYP-D3(BJ)/6-311G** level, in both calculations the IEFPCM
model was employed for representing water environment.
We first create a text file named multiple.txt with following content (prefix may be added to
the file name, such as valine_multiple.txt):
examples\spectra\NMR\valine\conf1.out 0.825
examples\spectra\NMR\valine\conf2.out 0.175

As can be seen, we have specified two input files with corresponding conformation weights. Note
that if you are using Linux version, the content must be written as follows, otherwise the paths
cannot be recognized, similarly hereinafter
"examples/spectra/NMR/valine/conf1.out" 0.825
"examples/spectra/NMR/valine/conf2.out" 0.175

Now boot up Multiwfn and input

12 // Do not show spikes to make the spectrum clearer
18 // Other plotting settings
5 // Set X position of legends

Now we select option 0 to replot, the current spectrum is already quite satisfactory

Experimental 1H NMR spectrum of valine in water is https://hmdb.ca/spectra/nmr_one_d/1582,
by comparing above map with it you can find our simulated NMR spectrum is reasonable and
captured all major features of the experimental one.

4.11.10.4 Plotting multiple systems simultaneously
Multiwfn is able to easily plot NMR spectra of multiple systems on the same map, as
exemplified below, the prerequisite is that all systems must have the same number of atoms. In this
example, we will view the two conformers of valine as two individual systems.
Create a file named multple.txt (additional prefix may be added to the file name) with following
content, each line contains path of an input file and corresponding legend
examples\spectra\NMR\valine\conf1.out conformer 1
examples\spectra\NMR\valine\conf2.out conformer 2

Boot up Multiwfn, load the multiple.txt, and then run all commands recorded in the
examples\spectra\NMR\valine\drawmulti.txt file in turn, you will see below map. The meaning of
each command can be easily understood according to the prompt on screen.

4.11.11 Plotting fluorescence spectrum of BODIPY
In this example, I illustrate how to plot fluorescence spectrum. The differences between
plotting fluorescence spectrum and UV-Vis absorption spectrum are two:
(1) To plot fluorescence spectrum, you should use optimized geometry of emission state (the
excited state which emits photon). While to plot absorption spectrum, you should use optimized
geometry of ground state.
(2) To plot fluorescence spectrum, oscillator strengths of all calculated excited states except
for the emission state should be manually set to zero to remove contribution of irrelevant states to
the spectrum.
Almost all molecules satisfy Kasha’s rule, that is fluorescence emission solely corresponds to
S1→S0 transition. So, the emission state commonly is S1 state.
Next, we will plot fluorescence emission for the well-known BODIPY molecule:

Kasha’s rule is assumed to be valid for this system, therefore we should optimize geometry of
S1 state. The output file of Gaussian 16 A.03 of this task at TD-B3LYP/6-311G* level is
examples\excit\BODIPY_S1_opt.out, frequency analysis is also performed because we want to
check if there is imaginary frequency (none is found). Note that “TD” keyword is employed without
additional options, in this case the lowest three excited states S1, S2 and S3 will be solved, and the
state of interest (the state to be optimized) is default to the first excited state (S1). The default setting
is well-suited for optimizing the S1 state.
Boot up Multiwfn and input
examples\excit\BODIPY_S1_opt.out
11 // Plot spectrum
3 // UV-Vis
After that, excitation energies and oscillator strengths of all excited states at the final geometry
(S1 geometry) are loaded into Multiwfn. Then we clean oscillator strengths of S2 and S3 states by
inputting following commands:
20 // Modify oscillator strengths
2,3 // Select S2 and S3
0 // New oscillator strength
Now you can input option 0 to plot the spectrum, however the default axis settings are not ideal.
So we input following commands
3 // Set lower and upper limit of X-axis,
300,750,50 // Lower limit, upper limit and step size in nm
4 // Set left Y-axis
0,1100,100 // Lower limit, upper limit and step size
y // Correspondingly scale the right Y-axis
After choose option 0, you will see the fluorescence spectrum

As shown in console window, the peak position of our simulated spectrum 510.7 nm, which is
quite close to the experimental peak position 512 nm (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BODIPY).
About plotting phosphorus spectrum
It is worth to note that if you are a Gaussian user, it is impossible to plot phosphorus spectrum
(corresponding to T1→S0 emission according Kasha’s rule) using above steps, because oscillator
strength must be exactly zero due to spin-forbidden if spin-orbit coupling (SOC) is not taken into
account, however Gaussian is unable to consider SOC effect in TDDFT calculation. To plot
phosphorus spectrum, my suggested steps are:
(1) Optimize T1 geometry using your favourite quantum chemistry program
(2) Based the T1 geometry, using Dalton program to calculate oscillator strength and excitation
energy of T1 state using TDDFT theory with consideration of SOC
(3) Extract the oscillator strength and excitation energy of T1 from Dalton output file and
manually write them to a plain text file in the format that can be recognized by Multiwfn, see Section
3.12.2 about the format.
(4) Load the plain text file into Multiwfn, then enter main function 11, select “UV-Vis”, then
directly select option 0 to plot spectrum, which will correspond to phosphorus spectrum.

4.11.12 Plotting partial vibrational spectrum (PVS) and partial
vibrational density-of-states (PVDOS)
The concept of partial vibrational spectrum (PVS) has been described in Section 3.13.6, please
carefully read it first if you lack of relevant knowledge. In the next sections I will illustrate how to
use Multiwfn to plot it to intuitively understand nature of various vibrational spectra. You will find
PVS is a very general and flexible analysis method. At the same time, plotting partial vibrational
density-of-states (PVDOS) will also be illustrated, which is a useful way of graphically revealing
composition of all (including spectral inactive) vibrational modes.

4.11.12.1 PVS-NC decomposition analysis of IR spectrum of C18B9N9
complex
In this example, we use PVS-NC method to visually understand composition of vibrational
modes corresponding to IR spectrum of a molecular complex C18B9N9, whose optimized geometry
is given below

4 Tutorials and Examples
The output file of frequency analysis task of Gaussian 16 program at B97XD/6-311G* level
will be used as input file to plot IR spectrum and PVS-NC curves, the file is provided as
examples\spectra\C18-B9N9.out. Note that “intmodes” option is specified in “freq” keyword, which
requests Gaussian to print compositions of redundant internal coordinates (RICs) in each vibrational
mode, the reason of adding this option is that in one of following examples I will illustrate how to
plot PVS-NC map based on fragments consisting of RICs. If you only want to define fragments as
a set of atoms, then this option is not needed.
Plotting common IR spectrum
We first plot a common IR spectrum of the C18B9N9 complex. Boot up Multiwfn and input
examples\spectra\C18-B9N9.out
11 // Plot various kinds of spectrum
1 // IR
0 // Plot spectrum on screen

From above map you can see many peaks, what are natures of them? Via PVS-NC curves, you
can easily understand which molecular fragment has a notable participation in the vibrational
motions (represented by corresponding normal coordinates) of the vibration modes that observable
in above map. While via PVS-I, you can visually understand if a molecular fragment has evident
contributions to IR absorption intensities of various peaks in the above map. So, PVS-NC and PVSI respectively focus on revealing different aspects of spectral active vibrational modes. In the rest
of this section, I will illustrate plotting PVS-NC curves, while in the next section, plotting PVS-I
will be exemplified. More specifically, the PVS-NC plotted in this section is PVS-NC(atom),
because we will define each fragment as a set of atoms.
Plotting PVS-NC(atom) map
Assume that we want to study how the motions of C18 atoms and B9N9 atoms contribute to the
vibrations corresponding to above IR spectrum, we should input the following commands in
spectrum plotting interface
24 // Set partial vibrational spectra (PVS) or vibrational DOS (VDOS)

From screen you can find composition of the two fragments we just defined in each vibrational

Select option 0 to plot spectrum, then you can see the following map on screen

In fact, there are three curves in the map, total IR spectrum (black), PVS of fragment 1 (C18,
red) and that of fragment 2 (B9N9, blue), the sum of the latter two corresponds to the former.
However, from the current map we can only clearly see that there is an extraordinary strong
absorption at about 2000 cm-1. Because the peak is fully in blue, we can conclude that this absorption
must purely correspond to vibration of B9N9.

653

From above map we can see there are many modest IR absorptions in the low frequency range.
To look into their details, we input following commands
3 // Set lower and upper limit of X-axis
750,350,50 // Lower limit, upper limit and interval of X-axis
4 // Set left Y-axis
0,3000,300 // Lower limit, upper limit and interval of left Y-axis
y // Correspondingly scale right Y-axis
16 // Set status of showing labels of spectrum minima and maxima
1 // Change displaying status of labels
1 // Show maxima on the spectrum
0 // Return
0 // Plot spectrum
Now you can see the following map

This map is very informative. For example, it is clear that the peak at 428.8 cm-1 almost solely
comes from vibration of C18, the peak at 531.4 cm-1 almost only corresponds to vibration of B9N9,
the peak at 484.0 cm-1 shows evident coupling vibration character. The normal coordinates of the
modes maximally corresponding to the aforementioned peaks are illustrated as follows, which are
in line with our expectation from inspecting the PVS map.

4 Tutorials and Examples

Although in this section I only illustrated defining two fragments, in Multiwfn in fact you can
maximally define as many as 10 fragments, all PVS curves can be shown together. The union of the
fragments does not necessarily correspond to the whole system.
It is noteworthy to emphasize that PVS curves only exhibit contribution of various fragments
to normal coordinates of various vibrational modes, they do not directly reflect fragment
contribution to absorption intensity. In other words, percentage contribution to normal coordinates
of a vibrational mode from a fragment is not proportional to its contribution to intensity of a
vibrational mode. This point should be correctly recognized when you discuss PVS/OPVS curves.
For example, from a PVS curve of a nonpolar group, you may observe that an evident IR-active
mode has a large composition of vibrational of the group in its normal coordinate, you should not
thus conclude that the vibrational of the nonpolar group is the source of the strong IR absorption.
Plotting OPVS map between fragments defined by atoms
We can also plot OPVS curve between two fragments to very conveniently examine
contribution of their collective vibration in different wavenumber ranges. To plot OPVS between
the C18 and B9N9, we input
24 // Set partial and overlap vibrational spectra
0 // Set OPVS
1,2 // OPVS will be drawn between fragments 1 and 2
d // Set display status of PVS/OPVS curves
1 // Disable showing PVS of fragment 1 for clarity
2 // Disable showing PVS of fragment 2 for clarity
q // Return
q // Return to spectrum plotting interface
0 // Plot spectrum again
Now you can see total IR spectrum along with OPVS curve

This OPVS map vividly shows coupling contribution to various IR absorption. In the region
between 450 and 500 cm-1, the coupling effect is strong; in particular, at 462.7 cm-1 the green curve
is very close to black curve, therefore, according the definition of OPVS described in Section 3.13.6,
we know that the corresponding IR-active mode should be completely and almost equally
contributed by vibrations of C18 and B9N9 moieties. From the PVS curves of the two fragment at
this wavenumber you can confirm this point. In contrast, the green curve in the wavenumber region
larger than 650 cm-1 is negligible, therefore, the peaks 652.9, 673.7 and 683.0 cm-1 must be solely
contributed by either one the two fragments. This example demonstrates that OPVS is very helpful
in quickly understanding vibrational coupling between various fragments in different wavenumber
ranges.

This section is to be written
Briefly speaking, VDOS is very similar to the vibrational spectrum with assumption that
intensity of all vibrational modes equals to 1. The relationship between PVDOS/OPVDOS to VDOS
is equivalent to that between PVS/OPVS and actual vibrational spectrum.
In this section I illustrate how to plot VDOS, partial VDOS (PVDOS) of fragments, and overlap
PVDOS (OPVDOS) between fragments. The C18B9N9 complex used in last section is still taken
as instance, and the two molecules will be defined as the two fragments.

From the map you can find vibrational modes sparsely distribute above 600 cm-1, while below
600 cm-1 the distribution of vibrational modes is much denser. In addition, it is found that the
vibrational modes above 600 cm-1 do not show detectable coupling motion between C18 and B9N9,
the strongly interfragment coupled modes occur densely around 500 cm-1 and below 100 cm-1. This
point can be viewed more clearly if you adjust limits of X-axis to only plot 0~600 cm-1 region, as
shown below. Peak positions of total spectrum are also labeled by means of option 16.

A very different point between VDOS and vibrational spectrum is that in the former, all modes
equally contribute to the curve, in other words, you can observe all modes; while in the latter, only
the modes with nonnegligible intensity have contribution to the curve and thus visually detectable.

Note: Chinese version of this topic is my blog article “Simulating UV-Vis absorption spectrum in specific
directions using Multiwfn” (http://sobereva.com/648).

As described in Section 3.13.1, directional UV-Vis spectrum can be plotted to study optical
absorption caused by interaction between a system and electric field oscillating in a specific
direction, this is particularly valuable if you are interested in anisotropy of spectral character.
In this section, we study carbon nanotube fragment with the following structure and orientation:

First, we plot UV-Vis spectrum of this system corresponding to interaction with electric field
oscillating parallel to XY plane. Now, boot up Multiwfn and input

Similarly, you can plot UV-Vis spectrum corresponding to interaction with electric field
oscillating along Z direction.
After plotting the aforementioned XY and Z spectra, if you export curve data and line data
to .txt file via option 2, then you can collectively import them into third-part software such as Origin
and draw a map containing total, XY and Z data, as shown below, in which the “Total” curve
corresponds to sum of XY and Z curves and also corresponds to the UV-Vis spectrum in common
sense.

In above map, it can be seen that the strongest absorption around 370 nm completely comes
from interaction of the system with electric field oscillating in XY plane. Since oscillating direction
of electric field is perpendicular to propagation direction of light, the XY curve can be understood
as the absorption curve for the light propagating in Z direction. The Z curve in above map
contributes most to the absorption around 300 and 480 nm, it corresponds to the absorption of the
light propagating on XY plane with polarization in Z direction. This observation also indicates that
only the electron excitations at these wavelengths possess prominent Z-directional transition dipole
moment.
This example shows that for systems with significant anisotropic features, plotting UV-Vis
spectra in specific directions clearly helps to understand the intrinsic nature of their absorption
spectra.

Please read section 3.13.7 to understand basic feature of the function of predicting color in
Multiwfn. In this section we will predict color of indigo based on theoretical calculation, and then
predict color of allura red based on its experimental UV-Vis spectrum.

After closing the window, Multiwfn shows the colors predicted based on the spectrum curve:

The color displayed under “color” label is the color corresponding to the UV-Vis spectrum, and the
color shown below “complementary color” corresponds to the color of transmission and reflection
light of indigo. The two colors shown at bottom side of the window are counterparts of the two
colors shown at upper side of the window by shifting RGB values so that the largest-value
component of the colors equal to 255 (upper limit of sRGB color space). In short, the very blue
color, as shown at the bottom-right corner of the window, can be regarded as the color actually
displayed by indigo aqueous solution. This predicted color is completely identical to actual color of
indigo, extremely successful prediction!
