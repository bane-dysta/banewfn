and then run them in turn in the VMD software.
Notice that the  tensor parsed by subfunction 1 of main function 24 corresponds to input
orientation (in contrast, the parsed  and  correspond to standard orientation), therefore, the
molecular structure file loaded into VMD must also correspond to input orientation, otherwise the
unit sphere representation map may be misleading. In order to yield the .pdb file corresponding to
input orientation, we change "iloadGaugeom" in settings.ini to 1, then reboot Multiwfn and input
examples\polar\C18\gamma.out // Geometry in input orientation will be loaded from this file
100 // Other function (Part 1)
2 // Generate new file
1 // Export current geometry as .pdb file
C18.pdb
Load the C18.pdb into VMD and show it in CPK style, you will see below figure

The character of this map is similar to that of  map. From the colored small arrows, it can be
seen that combination effect of three electric fields applied parallelly to the ring can induce a
relatively strong dipole moment variation in the same direction, while in the direction perpendicular
to the ring this phenomenon is much weaker.
From the vector representation, namely from the lengths of the three double-sided large arrows
along X, Y, and Z axes, one can better recognize the relative magnitude of  along the three directions.
Since the cyan arrow is quite short, the  in Z direction is relatively negligible.

4.25.3 Study iso-chemical shielding surface (ICSS) and magnetic
shielding distribution for benzene
Iso-chemical shielding surface (ICSS) denotes isosurface of magnetic shielding value, which
presents intuitive picture on aromaticity. If you are familiar with NICS, you can also simply view
ICSS as the isosurface of NICS with inverted sign. Please see Section 3.28.3 for more information.
In this example we will study benzene. Since this is a planar system, we will plot ICSSZZ instead of
ICSS, namely only the component of magnetic shielding tensor perpendicular to molecular planar
will be taken into account. ICSSZZ must be more physically meaningful than ICSS, just like NICSZZ
is a better aromaticity index than NICS (as demonstrated in Org. Lett., 8, 863 (2006)). Meanwhile I
will also show how to plot magnetic shielding values along a line and in a plane.
AFAIK, ICSSZZ was firstly proposed by me during implementation of ICSS in Multiwfn. So,
if ICSSZZ is involved in your work, please cite my study work containing ICSSZZ analysis: Carbon,
165, 468 (2020).
You should first prepare a Gaussian input file of standard single point task for present system,
which will be taken as template input file later. This file has already been provided as
examples\ICSS\benzene.gjf, in which the geometry has already been optimized at a reasonable level.
Boot up Multiwfn and input below commands
examples\ICSS\benzene.gjf // Note that molecular plane is in XY plane
25 // Electron delocalization and aromaticity analyses
3 // Generate grid data of ICSS or related quantities
1 // Low quality grid, magnetic shielding tensor at 130910 points will be calculated by
Gaussian later. Using "medium quality grid" could result in smoother maps, but the calculation will
be much more expensive. Note that the default extension distance is 12 Bohr, which is usually large
enough
n // Do not skip the step of generating Gaussian input file, because this is the first time we
carry out analysis and thus currently we do not have Gaussian input/output files in hand
Now Multiwfn generates a lot of Gaussian input files of NMR task in current folder based on
the template file. The files are named as NICS0001.gjf, NICS0002.gjf ... NICS0017.gjf. Run these
files by Gaussian, the NICS0001.gjf must be run as the first one. The output files can be directly
downloaded from here: http://sobereva.com/multiwfn/extrafiles/benzene_ICSS.rar.
Note: If these files cannot be run by your Gaussian normally, please check the tail of the output file, there are
two common reasons:
(1) The %mem is too small to finish the task, you need to set %mem in the template .gjf file to a large value
and retry.
(2) The "NICSnptlim" in settings.ini is too large, you should properly reduce it and try again. The reason is that
in Gaussian there is a limit on the number of Bq atoms, and it is somewhat dependent of the version of Gaussian and
your computer. For G09 D.01 and E.01, you should add "guess=huckel" keyword, otherwise due to memory
allocation bug, the NICSnptlim has to be reduced to a very small value to make Gaussian run normally (in this case
the overall computational cost will be quite high). If error occurs in Link401 when "guess=huckel" is used, then try
to use "guess=core" instead. For G16, the guess keyword is not needed.
Hint: You can make use of the script "examples\runall.sh" (for Linux) or "examples\runall.bat" (for Windows),
which invokes Gaussian to run all .gjf files in current folder to yield output files with the same name but with .out
suffix.

Assume that the output files (NICS0001.out, NICS0002.out...) have been placed in
"C:\benzene" folder, in Multiwfn you should input C:\benzene\NICS. We want to study ICSSZZ first,
therefore we choose "5: ZZ component", then Multiwfn loads all Gaussian output files and convert
magnetic shielding tensors to grid data of ICSSZZ. After that you will see a new menu, you can
directly visualize isosurface of the grid data by option 1, export it as cube file by option 2 or reselect

the form of ICSS by option -1. The isosurface of ICSSZZ = 2.0 ppm is shown below

As you can see, the green isosurface (positive Z-component shielding value), completely
covers the region above and below the benzene ring, suggesting that due to the induced ring current
originated from the globally delocalized π-electrons, the Z-direction external magnetic field is
largely shielded in these regions, this observation implies the strong aromaticity of benzene. From
below scheme we can understand the ICSSZZ more deeply; in the cylindrical region perpendicular
to and through the benzene, the direction of induced magnetic field (purple arrows) is exactly
opposite to external magnetic field (B0), this is why in this region Z-component of magnetic
shielding value is large.

You can also see, blue isosurface (negative Z-component shielding value) presents in the outlier
region of benzene, exhibiting de-shielding effect. This is mostly because the induced magnetic field
is parallel to B0 and thus enhances B0 in this region.
If you properly rotate viewpoint, you will clearly find the C-H bond is also completely covered
by the green surface. The reason is that the σ-electrons involved in the C-H bonding form
conspicuous local induced ring current, so the external magnetic field is also strongly shielded
around the C-H bond.
If you want to export current grid data as .cub file so that you can visualize it via third-part
softwares such as VMD, you can close the GUI window and select 2 to export the grid data to
ICSSZZ.cub in current folder.
Directly study ICSS based on existing Gaussian output files
Assume that you have already obtained the Gaussian output files for the ICSS purpose, and
you want to directly study ICSS, you should input following commands after booting up Multiwfn:
examples\ICSS\benzene.gjf
25 // Electron delocalization and aromaticity analyses
3 // Generate grid data of ICSS or related quantities
1 // Low quality grid
y // Skip generating Gaussian input files and thus directly load Gaussian output files

951

--- page break ---

4 Tutorials and Examples
C:\benzene\NICS
5 // Study ICSSZZ
As you can see, the grid setting we adopted this time is exactly identical to that we used to
generate the Gaussian input/output files, this point is extremely important. If the grid setting is not
the same, the file loading must be failed.
Plot plane map of magnetic shielding value
NOTICE: If you are only interested in plane map, it is strongly suggested to use subfunction 14 of main
function 25 to realize this purpose, which is much more convenient and the computational cost is significantly lower
than calculating the three-dimensional ICSS grid data. See Section 4.25.14 on how to easily plot NICS-2D plane
map. Note that NICS and ICSS only differ by sign.

Next, I will show how to plot magnetic shielding value in a plane. Since we already have grid
data of ICSSZZ in hand, magnetic shielding value at any point in a line/plane can be easily obtained
by means of interpolation technique based on the grid data.
We first plot color-filled map for ICSSZZ in the YZ plane with X=0. This plane is normal to
benzene and crosses C4-H10 and C1-H7. Set "iuserfunc" in settings.ini to -3, and then boot up a
new Multiwfn instance and input below commands
ICSSZZ.cub
4 // Plot plane map
100 //User-defined function, which now corresponds to the function interpolated by the grid
data of ICSSZZ.cub via B-spline algorithm
1 // Color-filled map
[Press Enter button]
0 // Set extension distance of the plot
8 // 8 Bohr
3 // YZ plane
0 // X=0
Now the graph pops up, close it and then input
4 // Show atom labels
3 // Blue
1 // Change lower and upper limit of color scale
-60,60
2 // Enable showing contour lines
-2 // Set label interval in X, Y and color scale axes
3,3,10
19 // Set color transition
8 // Blue-White-Red
-1 // Replot the map
Now you can see below map

From the graph one can find that although Z-component of magnetic shielding in the center of
benzene is a positive value, the magnitude is by far less than that in the regions above and below
the ring plane. The reason is clear, that is benzene only has π-aromaticity, while its σ-electrons are
not globally delocalized to form σ-aromaticity, so the shielding effect in the plane is relatively weak
due to lack of formation of σ-ring current.
Curve map of magnetic shielding value
NOTICE: If you are only interested in curve map, it is strongly suggested to use subfunction 13 of main
function 25 to realize this purpose, which is much more convenient and the computational cost is significantly lower
than calculating the three-dimensional ICSS grid data. See Section 4.25.13 on how to easily plot NICS curve map.

Next, we plot curve map to study the variation of magnetic shielding in the line perpendicular
to ring plane and starting from ring center. Choose -5 to return to main menu and input
3 // Plot curve map
100 // User-defined function
2 // Input coordinate of two points to define a line
0,0,-8,0,0,8 // The line starts from 8 Bohr below and above the ring center
You will immediately see

4 Tutorials and Examples
It can be seen that the maximum of Z-component of magnetic shielding occurs about 1.8 Bohr
above/below the ring plane. If you choose "6 Find the positions of local minimum and maximum",
you will see
Maximum X (Bohr):

6.122667

Value:

0.28936394E+02

Minimum X (Bohr):

8.000000

Value:

0.13254245E+02

Maximum X (Bohr):

9.882667

Value:

0.28937419E+02

That is the maximal value of ICSSZZ along the line is 28.9 ppm, whose position is 9.88-8=1.88 Bohr
(0.995 Å) above/below the ring plane. While at the ring center, the ICSSZZ is merely 13.2 ppm.
Beware that since the extension distance used in the calculation of grid data of ICSS ZZ is only 12 Bohr, when
we plot curve or plane map based on the interpolated data of ICSSZZ, the spatial range involved in the map should
not be too large. For example, we cannot plot the curve map from (0,0,0) to (0,0,20). If a point is beyond the valid
spatial range of grid data interpolation, the value will be 0.

Calculate NICS(0)ZZ and NICS(1)ZZ based on ICSSZZ data
It is noteworthy that if you already have ICSSZZ grid data, you can directly obtain the popular
NICS(0)ZZ and NICS(1)ZZ indices without doing any additional calculation, because the NICS value
at any point can be directly obtained in terms of interpolation of ICSSzz grid data. As an example,
we calculate NICS(1)ZZ. Ensure that "iuserfunc" in settings.ini has been set to -3 due to the
aforementioned reason, then boot up Multiwfn and input
ICSSZZ.cub
1 // Calculate function values at a point
0,0,1 // The point 1 Å above the ring center
2 // The inputted position is in Å
From screen you can find the "User-defined real space function" value is 28.9, namely the
NICS(1)ZZ is -28.9 ppm.
Epilogue
ICSS/ICSSZZ is really a very useful method for discussing aromaticity and anti-aromaticity,
many instances can be found in the original paper of ICSS (J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. 2, 2001,
1893), and in some applicative papers, such as J. Phys. Chem. C, 123, 18593 (2019) as well as my
research on cyclo[18]carbon, Carbon, 165, 468 (2020).
I strongly recommend you do some more practices about plotting and analyzing ICSS/ICSSZZ,
I provided some ideal exercise systems in "examples\ICSS" folder, including azulene,
cyclobutadiene, cycloheptatriene, porphyrin, propane and pyracylene; among them cyclobutadiene
is the simplest one. Below is the ICSS = 0.5 isosurface of cyclobutadiene showing in two styles;
from the graph it is clear that this system shows strong anti-aromaticity character, the 4n π-electrons
cause evident de-shielding effect in the cylindrical region perpendicular to and through the ring, this
situation is in complete contrast to benzene.

I wrote a very detailed post to discuss ICSS, in which all systems in "examples\ICSS" folder
are involved, see my blog article "Using Multiwfn to study aromaticity by drawing iso-chemical
shielding surfaces" (in Chinese, http://sobereva.com/216).

4.25.6 Calculate HOMA and Bird aromaticity index for phenanthrene
HOMA is the most prevalently used aromaticity index based on geometry equalization, see
Section 3.28.6 for detail. Here we use HOMA to study which ring of phenanthrene has stronger
aromaticity.
Since calculation of HOMA only requires molecular coordinate, you can simply use such
as .pdb and .xyz as input file. Of course, other files containing molecular coordinate, such as .wfn
and .fch files are acceptable too. The geometry in present instance is optimized under B3LYP/631G* level.

Boot up Multiwfn and input following commands
examples/phenanthrene.pdb
25 // Electron delocalization and aromaticity analyses
6 // Calculate HOMA and Bird aromaticity index
0 // Start the calculation
You will see the default parameters are printed, they are taken from J. Chem. Inf. Comput. Sci.,
33, 70 (1993), you can also change these parameters yourself via option 1 before the calculation.
Now we input the atom indices in the ring that we are interested in, we calculate HOMA for
the central ring first, so input 3,4,8,9,10,7, the input order must be consistent with atom connectivity.
You will immediately obtain the result shown below

HOMA value is

0.432442

Obviously, C4-C8 deviates to ideal bond length 1.388 most significantly, giving rise to large
negative contribution to HOMA, in other words, significantly broke aromaticity. The HOMA value
is calculated as 1 plus the contributions from all bonds in the ring.
Then input 8,15,14,13,11,9 to calculate HOMA for the boundary ring, the result is 0.855126.
Since this value is much closer to 1 than the one for central ring, HOMA suggests that the two
boundary rings have stronger aromaticity.
Bird index is another quantity used to measure degree of aromaticity, see Section 3.28.6 for a
brief description. Now choose option 2 to calculate Bird index for the two rings, you will find the
value for boundary ring is closer to 100 than the central ring. Likewise HOMA, Bird index also
indicates that the two boundary rings have stronger aromaticity.

4.25.13 Example of plotting one-dimension NICS curve, calculating
integral (INICS) and FiPC-NICS
Note: Chinese version of this section is my blog article “Using Multiwfn to plot one-dimensional NICS curve
and measure aromaticity by its integration” (http://sobereva.com/681), which also contains more discussion and
examples.

In this section I will illustrate how to plot NICS curve and calculate its integral (INICS index)
as well as FiPC-NICS index to study aromaticity. Please read Section 3.28.13 to gain some basic
knowledge.

4.25.13.1 Example 1: NICSZZ curve of infinitene
Infinitene molecule optimized at PBE0/6-31G* level is examples\NICS_scan\infinitene.pdb, as
shown below (two perspectives are given). In this example we will perform NICSZZ scan for the
highlighted ring. The scanning direction is perpendicular to the fitted ring plane to the outside of the
system and starts from geometric center of the ring.

Boot up Multiwfn and input following commands
examples\NICS_scan\infinitene.pdb //You can also use any other file format containing
structure information, similarly hereinafter

replaced with coordinates of scanning points, while other parts are kept unchanged
Now NICS_1D.gjf has been generated in current folder. You can load it into GaussView to
visualize the scanning points, see below. The purple spheres are Bq atoms, for which magnetic
shielding tensor will be calculated in the NMR task. It can be seen that all Bq atoms occur evenly
on the expected scanning line.

For reducing cost, manually changing the basis set in NICS_1D.gjf to 6-31G*. Then run it by
Gaussian. The corresponding input and output files have been provided as infinitene_NICS_1D.gjf
and infinitene_NICS_1D.out in “examples\NICS_1D” folder.
Next, in the Multiwfn window, input
2 //Load Gaussian output file of NICS-1D scanning
examples\NICS_scan\infinitene_NICS_1D.out //Gaussian output file
Then a new interface appears, the options are self-explanatory. A noteworthy option is -1, from
which you can choose the component of NICS to study. By default, the component perpendicular to
the fitting plane is used, which is most meaningful in characterizing aromaticity. We will refer it to

NICSZZ by assuming that Z is the direction normal to the fitting plane.
Now choose option 1 to plot NICS curve (currently corresponding to NICSZZ), you will see the
following map (you can flip the map horizontally by selecting option -3 once before choosing this
option)

It can be seen that the ring is aromatic, as the NICSZZ is evidently negative, especially at the
distance 1 Å to the ring center.
From screen you can also find integral of the curve:
Integral of NICS component:

-96.19 ppm*Angstrom

In addition, you can select option 5 to obtain extrema of the curve:

In this example, we will plot NICSZZ curve of benzene contributed by  and  electrons,
namely NICS,ZZ and NICS,ZZ, respectively. To plot NICS,ZZ, input the following commands after
booting up Multiwfn.

Next, in the Multiwfn window, input

Now you can see the following map. X=0 corresponds to position of ring center.

You can plot NICS,ZZ via almost exactly the same way, the only difference is that in the
template file you should specify indices of  MOs. The corresponding template file is
examples\NICS_scan\template_NMR_benzene-sigma.gjf.
In the “examples\NICS_scan\” folder, C5H5-.pdb and C7H7+.pdb are optimized C5H5− and
C7H7+ ions, respectively. You can use the same way as shown above to obtain their NICS,ZZ and

NICS,ZZ curves, relevant files are also provided in the folder. Note that in the interface, you can
choose option “3 Export NICS curve data along the line” to export curve data as plain text file. Then,
after importing the curve data corresponding to different situations into e.g. Origin, you can plot
them together, as shown below.

It can be seen that  electrons have considerable influence on NICSZZ around ring center. All
the three systems show comparable  aromaticity according to the NICS,ZZ curves. However, their
difference can be determined quantitatively from their integrals. The integral of NICS,ZZ for
benzene, C5H5− and C7H7+ are -142.45, -134.85 and -145.02 ppmÅ, respectively, indicating that
strength of  aromaticity is C7H7+  benzene > C5H5−.

In the post-processing menu of subfunction 13 of main function 25, FiPC-NICS aromaticity

Now NICS_1D.gjf has been generated in current folder, rename it as
benzene_NICS_1D_0to10.gjf and run it using Gaussian. The output file has been provided. Next,
we input
2 // Load Gaussian output file of NICS-1D scanning
examples\NICS_scan\benzene_NICS_1D_0to10.out //Gaussian output file
6 //Calculate FiPC-NICS
You will immediately see result:
FiPC-NICS is

-9.332247 ppm, at

1.179 Angstrom

The result indicates that at 1.179 Å above ring center of benzene, in-plane component of NICS
(NICSin) is vanished, and out-of-plane component of NICS (NICSout) is -9.33 ppm. This result is
very close to the corresponding data in original paper of FiPC-NICS (-9.59 ppm at 1.18 Å), in which
PBE0/6-311++G** was used in geometry optimization and NMR calculation.
Multiwfn also exported FiPC-NICS.txt in current folder, the meaning of each column is clearly
shown on screen. This file contains information of all scanning points. You can take the last two
columns, namely NICSin and NICSout, respectively as X-axis and Y-axis to plot scatter+line map.
The resulting map is shown below, which is in very good agreement with Fig. 1 of original paper of
FiPC-NICS.

4.25.14 Example of plotting two-dimension NICS plane map
Note: Chinese version of this section is my blog article “Using Multiwfn to easily plot two-dimensional NICS
plane maps to examine aromaticity” (http://sobereva.com/682), which also contains more discussion and examples.

In this section I will illustrate how to plot NICS plane map. Please read Section 3.28.14 to gain
some basic knowledge. Note that NICSZZ in the following examples refers to the NICS component
perpendicular to the plane of interest, Z does not always correspond to Z-axis.

4.25.14.1 Plotting NICSZZ plane map above 1 Å of coronene
In this example we plot color-filled NICSZZ plane map above 1 Å of coronene, the coronene

optimized at B3LYP/6-31G* level is examples\NICS_scan\coronene.pdb. The molecule is exactly
planar and lying at XY plane of Z=0.
Boot up Multiwfn and input following commands
examples\NICS_scan\coronene.pdb
25 //Electron delocalization and aromaticity analyses
14 //NICS-2D scan plane map
1 //Color-filled map
[Press ENTER button directly] //Using default number of grid points (100*100)
0 //Set extension distance
1 // 1 Bohr
1 //XY plane
1a //Z = 1Å
1 //Gaussian input file for NICS-2D scanning
examples\NICS_scan\template_NMR.gjf //Template input file of NMR task of Gaussian,
which is used to generate Gaussian input file for NICS-2D scan. [geometry] line in this file will be
replaced with coordinates of scanning points, while other parts are kept unchanged
NICS_2D.gjf has been generated in current folder, you can properly modify it according to
actual situation. Run it by Gaussian, the output file is examples\NICS_scan\coronene_NICS_2D.out.
Next, in Multiwfn window input
2 //Load Gaussian output file of NICS-2D scanning
examples\NICS_scan\coronene_NICS_2D.out
5 //Taking ZZ Cartesian component. Since the molecule is exactly in XY plane, the resulting
NICS will correspond to NICSZZ in common sense (i.e. the component normal to ring plane)
From screen you can find minimum and maximum of NICSZZ in the plane:
The minimum of data:

-43.3034000000000

The maximum of data:

11.3487000000000

Close the map shown on screen, then input the following commands to fine-tune the plotting
settings
4 //Enable showing atom labels
1 //Red
8 //Enable showing bonds
14 //Brown
17 //Set distance threshold for showing atom labels
5 //5 Bohr
y //Show labels of the atoms that beyond the threshold by light font
1 //Set lower&upper limit of color scale
-45,45
-8 //Change length unit of the graph to Angstrom
-2 //Set label intervals in X, Y, and color scale axes
2,2,10
2 //Enable showing contour lines
3 //Change contour line setting
8 //Generate contour value by arithmetic progression
-50,5,21 //Starting value, step, and total number

y //Removing existing contour lines. Then the contour values will be -50,-45,-40...40,45,50
1 //Save setting and return
-1 //Replot
Now you obtain the following map. From which it is clear that the outer rings has stronger
aromaticity than the internal ring, as NICSZZ above 1 Å of the former is evidently more negative
than that of the latter.

4.25.14.2 Plotting NICSZZ plane map above 1 Å of a phenyl ring of N(phenyl)3
In this example, we will plot NICSZZ plane map above 1 Å of the highlighted ring of N(phenyl)3
shown below. Since this ring is inclined with respect to Cartesian axis, we will use a special way to
define the plotting plane.

Boot up Multiwfn and input following commands
examples\NICS_scan\N(phenyl)3.pdb //Structure optimized at B3LYP/6-31G* level
25 //Electron delocalization and aromaticity analyses
14 //NICS-2D scan plane map

1 //Color-filled map
[Press ENTER button directly] //Using default number of grid points (100*100)
8 //The plotting plane is above or below the plane consisting of specific atoms
23,24,26,30,28,25 //Atoms in the ring of interest
Note that the unit vector normal to the fitting plane for the chosen atoms is shown on screen,
please record it, which will be used later:
The unit normal vector is

0.33076524

0.57300118

0.74984265

1 //The plotting plane is parallel to the fitting plane and at 1 Å above it. Negative value means
below it
6 //Length of the plotting plane (a square region) is set to 6 Å
Now you can find following information on screen:

If you load the N(phenyl)3.pdb into VMD and then run the above three commands in VMD console
window, and then properly adjust graphical representation, you will see the following map, which
illustrates the region corresponding to the plotting plane. It can be seen that the plotting plane has
been correctly defined.

Next, input the following commands
1 //Generate Gaussian input file for NICS-2D scanning
examples\NICS_scan\template_NMR.gjf //Template file of Gaussian for NMR task
Now NICS_2D.gjf has been generated in current folder, manually edit it to change the basis set
to 6-31G*, then run it by Gaussian. The output file has been provided as
examples\NICS_scan\N(phenyl)3_NICS_2D.out.
Then in Multiwfn window, input
2 //Load Gaussian output file of NICS-2D scanning
examples\NICS_scan\N(phenyl)3_NICS_2D.out
0 //Take the NICS component along specific direction
0.33076524 0.57300118 0.74984265 //The unit normal vector shown by Multiwfn earlier
Now the NICSZZ plane map has been shown on screen. Close it and properly adjust plotting
settings (refer to the rich examples in Section 4.4), finally you can obtain the map shown below,
which is fairly nice. Note that the color transition has been set to Yellow-Orange-Black,
