4.300.1 Example of visualizing free regions and calculating free volume
in a cell
Note: Chinese version of this topic is my blog article “Using Multiwfn to graphically display pores and free
regions in molecular dynamics” (http://sobereva.com/539) and “Using Multiwfn to calculate volume of free regions
in crystal structures and graphically display free regions” (http://sobereva.com/617), which contain more discussions
and introduced more skills.

Multiwfn is able to visualize free regions (i.e. pores or cavities) and calculating free volume in
a cell, please carefully read Section 3.300.1 for basic information and algorithm used in the function
illustrated in this section. Below I will exemplify this function by two examples.
Example 1: Coal structure produced by molecular dynamics simulation
In the first example, we take examples\coal.pdb as an instance, which is a frame of molecular
dynamics simulation of coal under periodic boundary condition:

Note that if you open this file by text editor, you can find the following line:

Meaning that the box is rectangle and the length in X, Y, Z is 31.064, 31.100, 31.093 Å, respectively.
Boot up Multiwfn and input

sides of the present cell
[Press ENTER button] // Use default grid space 0.25 Å, which is usually fine enough
Once the calculation of grid data is complete, you will find information about size of free
regions:
Volume of entire box:
Free volume:

30038.649 Angstrom^3

14783.074 Angstrom^3, corresponding to

49.21 % of whole space

This output shows that about half of the whole cell is not lying within the vdW surface of the system.
In the newly appeared menu, select option 3 to visualize isosurface of smoothed grid data, then
after selecting "Show molecule" and "Show data range" check boxes in the GUI, you will see
molecular structure along with the isosurfaces representing free regions:

It can be seen from the above map that the actual free regions are very vividly and clearly revealed
by the isosurfaces. The default isovalue is 0.5. If you increase it, the isosurfaces will shrink and only
significant pores will be visible. In contrast, if you decrease isovalue, existing isosurfaces will inflate
and more insignificant pores will appear in the graph.
Note: The choice of smoothing method significantly affects isosurface of smoothed grid data. As you can see
from above map, the Gaussian function with FWHM=1.8 Bohr works well for this system, but sometimes it does
not work reasonably as expected. For example, when the system consists of crowded atoms (e.g. atomic clusters),
this smoothing function may bring artificial effect because it decays too slowly, and sometimes the areas of the
isosurfaces corresponding to free regions are too small or fully disappeared. In this case you can try other smoothing
functions, such as Becke function or error function, the default one is error function with scale factor of 1.0. You can
also try to Gaussian function with smaller FWHM than the present example.

In the post-processing menu, you can also export the smoothed grid data as a .cub file, so that
you can render it via third-part visualization tools, such as VMD, ChimeraX and VESTA. You can
also find option used to visualize isosurface of raw grid data, however, as you will see, this
isosurface can hardly be used to exhibit pore character in the present system, and the isosurface is
very jagged, rendering importance of the smoothing algorithm employed in Multiwfn, see Section
3.300.1 for detail of the grid data calculation algorithm.
It is worth to note that as shown in Section 4.200.14.2, domain analysis module of Multiwfn is
also able to visualize cavity and calculate cavity volume, however this module is only suitable for
investigating internal cavity of a single molecule, it cannot be used to study all pores in a large cell
like the present system.

Part 2: Covalent organic frame crystal
Multiwfn is also able to view free region and calculate its volume for experimentally
determined molecular crystal. In this example I illustrate this point by taking a covalent organic
frame (COF) system as an instance. Note that though the cell of this crystal is non-orthogonal,
Multiwfn also works correctly.
Boot up Multiwfn and input
examples\COF_12000N2.cif
300 // Other functions (Part 3)
1 // Viewing free regions and calculating free volume in a cell
1 // Set grid and start calculation
[Press ENTER button] // Use default origin (0,0,0)
[Press ENTER button] // Use default box lengths
[Press ENTER button] // Use default grid space 0.25 Å
The quantitative data shown on screen is
Volume of entire box:
Free volume:

2996.151 Angstrom^3

1953.217 Angstrom^3, corresponding to

65.19 % of whole space

Clearly, the COF must have low density since its free volume occupies approximately as large as
2/3 of the whole cell.
When grid is non-orthogonal, Multiwfn is unable to directly plot its isosurface map, so this
time we choose option 4 in post-processing menu to export smoothed grid data as free_smooth.cub
in current folder. After that, load it into VMD software (http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/), go
to “Graphics” - “Representation”, set drawing method of the system to “Licorice”, then add a
representation for showing isosurface, and change the settings as the following screenshot (the VMD
I am using is version 1.9.3)

Then in the console window, input pbc box to draw frame of grid data, and set background color to
white, you will see

The graphical effect is very satisfactory, the free region is nicely revealed.
By the way, if you set the drawing method of the structure to “VDW”, you will find the
isosurface of free region and van der Waals surface form an obvious complementarity, indicating
that the free region is indeed reasonably exhibited.

You can also use VESTA software to plot the free region map based on the free_smooth.cub,
the graphical effect is even better, see http://sobereva.com/617 for detail.

4.300.2 Example of fitting radial atomic density as STOs or GTFs
Multiwfn is able to fit spherically averaged electron density of an isolated atom as multiple
Slater type orbitals (STOs) or Gaussian type functions (GTFs), please read Section 3.300.2 to gain
basic knowledge. In this section, I will illustrate how to use this function to realize the fitting.

4.300.2.1 Crudely fitting radial density of silicon as several STOs
In this section we will fit radial density of silicon atom as linear combination of a few STOs.
Since the number of fitting functions is small, the fitting procedure is rapid and evaluation of fitted
density is quite expensive, however, the fitting quality is not expected to be very high.
Boot up Multiwfn and input
examples\atomwfn\Si.wfn // Generated at ROHF/6-31G* level
300 // Other functions (Part 3)
2 // Fitting atomic radial density as multiple STOs or GTFs
3 // Check or set initial guess of coefficients and exponents of fitting functions
2 // Set initial guess as "crude fitting by a few STOs with variable exponents". Then from
screen you can find only four STOs will be employed in the fitting, their initial status are

By default, 4000 evenly distributed points with spacing of 0.001 Å are used for fitting, clearly
they cover radial range of r = 0-4 Å. If you have carefully read Section 3.300.2, you will find the
outputted information during the fitting is quite easy to understand. The second half of the output is
shown below

As you can see, the integral of the originally fitted density over the whole space is 13.13399890,
therefore the coefficients of the fitting functions are scaled by 14/13.13399890=1.06593583, where
14 is the actual number of electrons of silicon. In the current fitting, both coefficients and exponents
of the four STOs are optimized, the final parameters are printed under "Fitted parameters (a.u.) after
scaling" title. The RMSE is a quantity useful in quantitatively measuring fitting quality. The r2
coefficient between fitted density and actual density is as high as 0.99, implying that the fitting is
reasonable; however, it is highly suggested also employing other ways to further examine the fitting
quality and confirm the fitting reliability, so that the fitted parameters can be safely used in practical
studies to estimate density.
In the newly appeared menu you can see many options, whose meanings are either selfexplanatory or have been described in Section 3.300.2.2. To quantitatively check fitting quality at
the 4000 fitting points, we select option 1, then you will see

The "Diff" is difference between fitted density and actual density, the values in the parentheses are
relative errors. As can be seen, the error in the region very close to nucleus is not small, however it
does not matter since this region is not of chemical interest, usually chemists mainly focus on
electron density in valence region.
Next, we choose option 3 to visually inspect curves of fitted density and actual density using
logarithmic scaling, then you will see

The fitting is evidently successful, since the fitted density curve is close to actual density curve in
the region within 1.8 Å. It is worth to mention that Bondi vdW radius of silicon is 2.1 Å.
You can also select option 4 to plot comparison map between fitted density and actual density
using linear scaling, you will further find that the fitted density indeed nicely reproduces the actual
density.
If you select option 5, then fitdens.txt will be outputted in current folder. This file contains
fitted density (the second column) at points evenly distributed from 0 to 10 Å, the grid spacing is
half of the fitting points, namely 0.001/2=0.0005 Å. From the data in this file you can find that the
fitted density varies smoothly and monotonically, no negative value can be found, further implying
that the fitting is successful and the fitted parameters are reliable.
Finally, we select option 6 to examine integral of fitted density over the whole space via
different number of points of Gaussian quadrature, you will see:
Number of integration points:

(14), further demonstrating that our fitting is reasonable.
Since our fitted density has passed quality check in many ways, we can finally conclude that
the fitted parameters of the four STOs can be safely and reliably employed in future researches.

4.300.2.2 Accurately fitting radial density of bromine as many GTFs
In order to reliably and exactly fit radial density, usually no less than 10 GTFs (with variable
exponents) are needed. In this example we will fit radial density of bromine atom in this way. This
kind of fitting is almost suitable for any element in the periodic table.
Boot up Multiwfn and input
examples\atomwfn\Br.wfn // Generated at ROHF/6-31G* level
300 // Other functions (Part 3)
2 // Fitting atomic radial density as STOs or GTFs
3 // Check or set initial guess of coefficients and exponents of fitting functions
5 // Fine fitting by 10 GTFs with variable exponents (of course, using more GTFs will result
in better fitting)
As can be seen from screen, 10 GTFs will be employed in the fitting, all coefficients are initially
set to 1.0, while their exponents span large range, the smallest one is 0.1, while the largest one is
381, the ratio between two neighbouring GTFs is 2.5. The GTFs with small, medium and large
exponents are mainly used to represent tail region, valence region and the region very close to
nucleus, respectively.
Then input 0 to return to upper level of menu and then choose option 1 to start fitting. During
fitting, from prompt you can find 1 redundant fitting function is automatically eliminated to avoid
numerical problems, which has a very small coefficient:
Delete redundant function (coeff=-5.59231E-05 exp= 9.99991E-02), refitting...

From this data we can find the fitting quality is almost perfect! The r2 is almost exactly 1.0!
Please use the same way as illustrated in the last section to examine fitting quality, you will
find current fitting is completely successful. For example, after choosing option 3 we can see the
following map, which exhibits that the fitting quality in all regions is perfect.

Clearly, the fitting procedure illustrated in this section is quite ideal when you want to reach
very high fitting quality.
By the way, from the parameters of the fitted GTF functions shown earlier, you can find GTF
3 and GTF 4 have almost identical exponent, that means they can be combined as a single GTF to
reduce the parameters. To do so, we input
0 // Return
3 // Check or set initial guess of coefficients and exponents. Then from screen you can find
the parameters we fitted earlier
10 // Combine two fitting functions together
3,4 //Indices of the two fitting functions to combine
0 // Return
1 // Start fitting
Then you can use option 3 to visualize the radial density again, you will find the quality of the fitting
via the current 8 GTFs is unchanged, so 8 GTFs are fully adequate to reach an accurate fitting for
present atom.
The fitting module in Multiwfn is quite flexible, there are many options used to control fitting
strategy, see Section 3.300.2 for more information.

4.300.4 Example of simulating scanning tunneling microscope (STM)

Note: Chinese version of this topic is my blog article “Using Multiwfn to simulate scanning tunneling
microscopy (STM) images” (http://sobereva.com/549, in Chinese), in which extended discussion is given and
cyclo[18]carbon is taken as example.

in Multiwfn. In the next two sections, we will respectively simulate STM of constant height and
constant current modes for phenanthrene. The simulation will be based on the wavefunction in
examples\phenanthrene.fch, which was generated at B3LYP/6-31G* level.
It is important to note that in order to simulate STM in Multiwfn, the molecule must be parallel
to XY plane (though the molecule is not necessarily planar), however, in the phenanthrene.fch the
molecule is parallel to YZ plane. Therefore, the molecule must be rotated prior to STM simulation.
Of course, we can first reorient the molecule and then conduct a single point task via quantum
chemistry to generate wavefunction file, but a better way is using Multiwfn to directly rotate the
wavefunction and geometry, namely inputting below commands in Multiwfn
examples\phenanthrene.fch
6 // Check & modify wavefunction
33 // Rotate wavefunction, namely X→Y, Y→Z, Z→X
0 // Rotate all orbitals
y // Also rotate molecule structure. Then the molecule will be on XZ plane
33 // Rotate wavefunction again
0 // Rotate all orbitals
y // Also rotate molecule structure
Now the phenanthrene has exactly been on XY plane of Z=0 Å (you can check this point via
main function 0). Then we enter main function 100, choose subfunction 2 and then select
corresponding option to export the present wavefunction to a new .mwfn file. In the next sections,
this new file will be referred to as mol.mwfn.

4.300.4.1 Simulating constant height STM image for phenanthrene
Here we simulate STM image of constant height mode for phenanthrene. Boot up Multiwfn
and input
mol.mwfn
300 // Other function (Part 3)
4 // Simulating STM image
From the message on screen it can be seen that the Fermi level (EF) has been set to average of
HOMO energy and LUMO energy, the bias voltage (V) has been automatically set to the difference
between HOMO energy and EF, in this case only HOMO can contribute to the STM image. In order
to obtain expected STM image, it is crucial to properly define the V. In the case of negative V,
electrons flow from sample to STM tip, and the more negative the V, the more MOs may contribute
to the STM image. Also, note that the distance between the atoms in the sample and the tip
significantly affects STM image. From the information on option 7 you can find the default Z
coordinate of the plane to be plotted is 0.7 Å. Since all atoms in the mol.mwfn have Z coordinate of
0 Å, the distance between the nuclei and the tip is 0.7 − 0.0 = 0.7 Å. In this example, we will plot
STM image with V= -5.0 V at Z=1.2 Å.
Now input below command
2 // Set bias voltage
-5 // Bias voltage of -5.0 V
7 // Set Z coordinate
1.2 // Z=1.2 Å
0 // Calculate tunneling current on the plane
Now you can find below information on screen

Calculating, please wait...
Maximal value (LDOS) is

0.010218 a.u.

It can be seen that there are 4 occupied MOs whose energy is lying between EF+eV (-8.362 eV)
and EF (-3.362 eV), therefore the plane data of the STM image corresponds to sum of their
probability densities in the plane multiplied by their occupation numbers (2.0 in present case since
they are all close-shell MOs), this data is also known as local density-of-states (LDOS). As shown
in the prompt, the largest value of LDOS in the calculated plane is 0.010218 a.u.
Now you are in the STM plotting menu, you can find many options used to adjust plotting
effect, they are all self-explanatory, please play with them. We directly choose option 0 to plot the
image under default setting, you will see

In this map, the brighter the white, the larger the LDOS and thus the stronger the tunneling
current (I), since the Tersoff-Hamann model shows that I is positively proportional to LDOS. It can
be seen that I signal is more prominent over the two boundary six-membered rings than the central
one.

4.300.4.2 Simulating constant current STM image for phenanthrene
In this section we again plot STM image for phenanthrene but using constant current mode.
Boot up Multiwfn an input

4 Tutorials and Examples
4 // Simulating STM image
1 // Switch the mode of STM image to constant current
2 // Set bias voltage
-5 // Again we use bias voltage of -5.0 V
In the constant current mode, LDOS is calculated for every evenly distributed point in a 3D
region, whose X, Y and Z range can be set by options 5, 6 and 7, respectively, usually the default
setting is appropriate. We directly choose option 0 to start the calculation, from the information on
screen you can find the maximal value of LDOS in the calculated region is 0.048 a.u.
In the post-processing menu you can find several options, we first use option 1 to visualize
isosurface map of tunneling current, which corresponds to LDOS in the present context. The
isosurface corresponding to LDOS=0.015 a.u. is shown below. Note that although the choice of
isovalue is arbitrary, it should be between 0 and the maximum value (0.048 a.u. in this example)

In above map, the isosurfaces of tunneling current normally occur over the carbons, implying that
the default calculated region is appropriate for the present case. The blue box can be shown by
clicking "Show data range" check box, it displays the region where LDOS was calculated.
Next, we plot plane map. Select option "3 Calculate and visualize constant current STM image"
and then input the expected value of tunneling current, we input 0.01 in this example. After that,
Multiwfn starts to calculate the Z value where tunneling current (LDOS) is approximately equal to
0.01 a.u., evidently Z is different at different (x,y) positions. Then from screen you can find
Minimal Z is

0.700000 Angstrom

Maximal Z is

1.206432 Angstrom

They are proper lower and upper limits of the color scale of STM image, respectively.
Now you are in the interface of plotting STM image of constant current mode, we input below
commands
2 // Choose map type
2 // Color-filled map with contour lines
7 // Set label interval in X, Y and color scale axes
1.5,1.5,0.05
-3 // Change other plotting settings
2 // Set number of decimal places of tick labels
1 // Set X axis

current (LDOS) of 0.01 a.u., the Z position of STM tip is relatively high over the two boundary sixmembered rings. The characteristics of this map is very similar to the STM image of constant height
mode.
If you want to further investigate STM plane map with other constant current value, you can
exit the plotting interface, then enter the option "3 Calculate and visualize constant current STM
image" again and input the expected current value.

4.300.5 Calculate electric dipole moment, multipole moments and
electronic spatial extent for uracil
As described in Section 3.300.5, Multiwfn is able to analytically calculate electric dipole
moment, quadrupole, octopole, hexadecapole moments and electronic spatial extent <r2>. In this
section we calculate these quantities for a simple molecule, uracil.
Boot up Multiwfn and input
examples\uracil.wfn

The calculation is quite fast, you will immediately see below information, which are very easy
to understand if you have read Section 3.300.5. As clearly indicated on screen, the unit is a.u. unless
otherwise specified.

If "ispecial" in settings.ini is set to 1, then before calculating dipole and multiple moments, the
system will be displaced to make nuclear contribution to dipole moment zero.
Note that you can also use subfunction 2 of main function 15 to calculate above quantities,
however it calculates numerically based on multicenter grids, the cost is significantly higher while
the numerical accuracy is slightly lower. However, it has a unique advantage, namely it can calculate
dipole and multipole moments for specific fragments in current system, see Section 4.15.3 for
example.
The <r2> is a useful index to quantitatively characterize the breadth of the distribution of
electrons, I have a blog article to discuss this point in detail: http://sobereva.com/616 (in Chinese).

4.300.6 Calculating orbital energies: NTO orbital as an example
As described in Section 3.300.6, Multiwfn has a function to evaluate energies of the orbitals
stored in memory based on the user-provided Fock/Kohn-Sham matrix. In principle, one can use
this function to calculate energies of orbitals of any kind! In this example, I will illustrate how to
make use of this function to evaluate energies of natural transition orbitals (NTOs). S0→S1
excitation of a typical donor--acceptor system will take as the example. Please make sure that you
have understood how to perform NTO analysis, see Section 4.18.6 for example. The present
example contains three steps: (1) Generating NTO orbitals by TDDFT calculation (2) Generating a
file containing Fock/Kohn-Sham matrix (3) Calculating NTO orbital energies.
First, we generate NTO orbitals, the Gaussian input file of TDDFT task is examples\excit\Dpi-A.gjf, the corresponding output file and .fchk file have also been provided in the same folder.
Boot up Multiwfn and input the following commands
examples\excit\D-pi-A.fchk
18 // Electron excitation analysis
6 // Generate natural transition orbitals (NTOs)
examples\excit\D-pi-A.out
1 // The first excited state (S1 state)
Then you can see
The highest 10 eigenvalues of occupied NTOs:
0.000022

0.000023

0.000038

0.000057

0.000105

0.000149

0.000172

0.000339

0.008236

0.992492

The highest 10 eigenvalues of virtual NTOs:
0.992492

0.008236

0.000339

0.000172

0.000149

0.000105

0.000057

0.000038

0.000023

0.000022

These data display that NTO works well for the present case, since the NTO pair with highest
eigenvalue contributes 99.2% to this excitation, namely the S0→S1 excitation can be almost
perfectly represented by this NTO transition. Then we choose option 3 to export the NTOs as
NTO.mwfn in current folder.
Next, we generate a file containing Kohn-Sham matrix of present system, see Section 3.100.17
for details. Boot up Multiwfn and input
examples\excit\D-pi-A.fchk
100 // Other functions (Part 1)
17 // Generate Fock/KS matrix based on orbital energies and coefficients
KS.txt
Now the KS.txt in current folder contains the Kohn-Sham matrix converted back from the
energies and coefficients of molecular orbitals in the D-pi-A.fchk.
Finally, we calculate energies of the NTO orbitals. Boot up Multiwfn and input
NTO.mwfn

6 // Calculate energies of the present orbitals

Then Multiwfn loads Kohn-Sham matrix from the KS.txt file, and the calculation of the NTO
orbital energies is finished immediately. You can then export the energies to orbene.txt in current
folder by choosing “1 Export orbital energies to orbene.txt in current folder”, the content will be

In the NTO.mwfn, the occupied and unoccupied NTOs with highest eigenvalue are orbitals 56
and 57, respectively, according to the above data their energies are found to be -9.4672 and -0.7101
eV, which are very reasonable.
Note that there are also other ways to provide Kohn-Sham matrix to Multiwfn, see Appendix
7 of this manual. For example, you can also use Gaussian to directly generate .47 file, which can
also provide Kohn-Sham matrix to Multiwfn for generating orbital energies. Now I illustrate how
to do. We create a new Gaussian input file with the following content, notice that the geometry, DFT
functional and basis set must be exactly identical to the examples\excit\D-pi-A.gjf. (this file has
already been provided as examples\excit\D-pi-A_get47.gjf)

$NBO archive file=C:\D-PI-A $END

After running this file by Gaussian, you will obtain D-PI-A.47 file in C:\ folder, it has been
provided as examples\excit\D-PI-A.47. Then after choosing subfunction 6 in main function 300, you
can input path of this .47 file, Multiwfn will load Kohn-Sham matrix from it and then calculate
orbital energies.
Due to numerical reason, the Kohn-Sham matrix recorded in the .47 file and that directly generated by Multiwfn
are marginally different, hence the resulting NTO energies are also slightly different in the two cases. However, the
difference is fully negligible for practical studies.
When diffuse functions are heavily employed and thus quantum chemistry code automatically eliminated some
linearly dependent basis functions, Multiwfn will be unable to directly generate Kohn-Sham matrix, and you have
to use other ways to provide Kohn-Sham matrix to Multiwfn, such as using .47 file.

4.300.8 Plotting surface distance projection map for [Ru(bpy)3]2+ cation
coordinate
Note: Chinese version of this tutorial with more discussions is "Using Multiwfn to plot surface distance
projection map for molecules and solids" (http://sobereva.com/589).

Please read Section 3.300.8 first to gain basic knowledge about the molecular surface distance
projection map. In this section, [Ru(bpy)3]2+ will be taken as an example to show how to plot this
kind of map. The examples\excit\Ru(bpy3)2+.gjf contains optimized geometry of this system,
therefore it will be used as input file (of course, you can also use file in other formats such
as .xyz, .pdb and .mol2 as input file). The system is already in an appropriate orientation for studying
burying of Ru atom by the ligands, see below figure. If the current orientation is not suitable for
plotting this map, you should use molecular visualization softwares such as GaussView to rotate it.

Boot up Multiwfn and input
examples\excit\Ru(bpy3)2+.gjf
300 // Other functions (Part 3)
8 // Plot molecular surface distance projection map
This time we do not alter any default setting, but simply select option 0 to start calculation. In
this case, the molecular surface is defined as isosurface of promolecular electron density of 0.05 a.u.
Once the calculation is finished, you will enter an interface for plotting plane map. We directly
choose option 0 to show the map on screen, you will see

As you can see, different colors nicely exhibit the distance of various regions of molecular surface
to screen, the relative position of Ru atom and ligands can be very clearly detected. Under the default
setting, Z=0 corresponds to the Z position of the atom having most positive Z coordinate. If the
current map does not make you satisfied, you can close the map and use the rich options in the
interface to further improve graphical effect.
Next, we plot this map again but using another molecular surface definition, namely
superposition of atomic van der Waals spheres. Now input the following commands
-1 // Return
1 // Set definition of molecular surface
3 // Superposition of atomic van der Waals spheres scaled by a factor
1 // We do not scale van der Waals radii in this example, so we set scale factor to 1
0 // Start calculation
0 // Show the map on screen
Then you will see the following figure, from which it is obvious that the Ru atom is heavily
buried by surrounding ligands, and due to the strong steric hindrance, foreign molecule is not easy
to approach the Ru atom.
