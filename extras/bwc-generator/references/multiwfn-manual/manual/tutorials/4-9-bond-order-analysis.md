In order to understand the chemical meaning of the data, we can select 0 to return to upper
level of menu, and then select option "0 Visualize attractors and basins". In the GUI window, select
basin 5 to visualize it, you will see the left figure shown below. If you use main function 0 to plot
isosurface map of the orbital 10, you will see the right figure shown below (isovalue = 0.09).

It can be seen that the orbital 10 partially exhibits bonding character between C5 and Cl7, while
basin 5 directly corresponds to bonding basin and can be symbolized as V(C5,Cl7), evidently this
basin should have notable contribution to orbital 10. From the orbital composition data shown above,
the contribution by basin 5 is indeed prominent (18.2 %), showing that the ELF basin contributions
evaluated in the aforementioned way is reasonable.

4.9 Bond order analysis
In this section I will illustrate how to use Multiwfn to perform different kinds of bond order
analyses to characterize chemical bonds.

4.9.1 Mayer bond order and fuzzy bond order analysis on acetamide
This instance exemplifies how to calculate Mayer bond order and fuzzy bond order for
acetamide. Related theories have been introduced in Sections 3.11.1 and 3.11.6, respectively. Finally,
I introduce a skill, namely labelling the calculated bond orders to molecular structure map by means
of GaussView, so that you can examine bond orders easier.
Calculation of Mayer bond order
We first calculate Mayer bond order. Note that calculating Mayer bond order requires basis
function information, thus currently .mwfn/.fch/.molden/.gms file must be used as input file.

By default, only the bond order terms larger than specific criteria will be outputted, the criteria
can be adjusted in "bndordthres" in settings.ini. Mayer bond order often coincide with empirical
bond order well. In this example, bond order between C5 and O6 is 1.9, which is very close to ideal
value 2.0 (double bonds).
Total valence of an atom is the sum of Mayer bond orders that it formed. Free valence of a
atom measures its remained capacity to form new bonds by sharing electron pairs, for closed-shell
this quantity is always zero.
Then if you choose "y", entire bond order matrix will be outputted to bndmat.txt in current
folder.
Orbital occupancy-perturbed Mayer bond order analysis
Next, we want to try to find which orbitals have main contributions to Mayer bond order
between C5 and O6, calculating the so-called "Orbital occupancy-perturbed Mayer bond order" is
useful for realizing this goal. Hence, we select option 6 in bond order analysis module, and then
input 5,6. Below information will be outputted:

Summing up occupancy perturbation from all orbitals:

-2.03987

From the output we can know that, for example, if the two electrons are removed from orbital
15, then Mayer bond order between C5 and O6 will be decreased from 1.903928 to 1.743383 (i.e.
1.903928-0.160545), we can also say that the contribution from orbital 15 is 0.160545. The sum of
contributions from all occupied MOs is 2.03987, the reason that this value is not equal to 1.903928
is that Mayer bond order is not a linear function of density matrix, we do not need to concern this.
Orbital 14 has the largest negative value of orbital occupancy-perturbed Mayer bond order,
therefore this orbital must be greatly beneficial to the bonding. This conclusion can be further
testified by visual inspection of the orbital isosurface, see the graph given at the end of Section 4.8.1.
As expected, this orbital shows strong character of π-bonding between C5 and O6.
Calculation of fuzzy bond order
Now we calculate fuzzy bond order. Unlike Mayer bond order, fuzzy bond order does not rely
on basis function, therefore you can also use such as .wfn/.wfx as input file. Calculating fuzzy bond
order is more time consuming than Mayer bond order, its advantage over Mayer bond order is that
the basis set sensitivity is greatly reduced, and using diffuse basis functions will never deteriorate
result.
In the bond order analysis menu, we select "7 Fuzzy bond order analysis", the result will be
printed, as shown below

bond orders are very similar, in fact this is the common case. However, for highly polar bonds their
results may deviate with each other relatively evidently.
Skill: Labelling bond orders on molecular structure map by GaussView
If you have GaussView (version  6.0), you can use it to show the bond orders calculated by
Multiwfn on the molecular structure map to facilitate examining their values. Here I use Mayer bond
order of acetamide as instance to illustrate this point.
Boot up Multiwfn and input
examples\CH3CONH2.fch
9 // Bond order analysis
1 // Calculate Mayer bond order
y // Export the bond order matrix as bndmat.txt in current folder
0 // Return to main menu
1000 // Hidden main function
13 // Convert the bndmat.txt in current folder to Gaussian .gjf file with bond order information
Now we have gau.gjf in the current folder, which not only contains present molecular
coordinate, but also contains bond orders between the connected atoms (the connectivity is
automatically guessed based on current geometry, unless you employ a file containing connectivity
information as input file, such as .mol and .mol2, see Section 2.5 for detail).
Load the gau.gjf into GaussView, select "Results" - "Bond Properties", then after proper
adjustments, you can obtain below effect.

As can be seen, we also requested GaussView to use different colors to exhibit the bond orders. The
more green the color, the larger the bond order; the redder the color, the smaller the bond order.

4.9.2 Multi-center bond order analysis on Li6 cluster and phenanthrene
The electron structure character of complex systems, such as cluster or system containing wide
range electron delocalization is hard to be investigated by simple chemistry empirical rules, we have
to resort to wavefunction analysis methods. In this section, examples of applying multi-center bond
order to reveal multi-center interaction are given. If you are not familiar with multi-center bond
order, please check Section 3.11.2 to gain basic knowledge. Notice that multi-center bond order
analysis requires basis function information, therefore you have to use .mwfn/.fch/.molden/.gms file

as input file.
Part 1: Studying three-center bond in Li6 cluster
In the planar Li6 cluster, as shown in below map, there are two kinds of three-membered rings,
namely the three boundary ones and the central one. We will use multi-center bond order to study
which kind of three-membered ring is more stable.
Boot up Multiwfn and input following commands
examples\Li6.fch
9 // Bond order analysis
2 // Multi-center bond order analysis
1,3,4 // Indices of the atoms in the boundary three-member ring
The output is
The multicenter bond order:

0.1247848038

The normalized multicenter bond order:

0.4997129069

Then we calculate three-center bond order of the central three-member ring, therefore we input
1,2,3, the result is
The multicenter bond order:

0.0351782167

The normalized multicenter bond order:

0.3276608901

Since the number of atoms in both the rings is the same, you only need to compare their "The
multicenter bond order" values. The data are marked in the below graph. The pink texts denote
Mayer bond orders.

From the three-center bond order values, it is evident that the boundary three-member rings
are more stable (i.e. more strongly binded) than the central one, this conclusion is also somewhat
reflected by the Mayer bond orders. We can further demonstrate this conclusion by plotting LOL
graph in the cluster plane (see Section 4.4.2 on how to plot this kind of map)

It is clear that electrons tend to localize in the boundary three-membered rings to stabilize them,
the conclusion of this real space function analysis is in good agreement with the bond order analysis.
By checking Laplacian map, ELF map, electron density deformation and valence electron density
map, you can draw exactly the same conclusion.
The Li6.fch used in this example was produced at B3LYP/6-31G* level. Usually diffuse
functions should be employed for properly describing anionic systems, in this case you should
evaluate the multi-center bond order based on natural atomic orbitals (NAO) rather than based on
original basis functions as illustrated above, otherwise the result may be completely useless, see
Section 3.11.2 for detail (also see Part 3 of this section for example). Alternatively, you can remove
diffuse functions and perform single point task to generate the wavefunction used for multi-center
bond order analysis, however the basis set should be at least three-zeta quality, e.g. 6-311G(2d,p) or
def2-TZVP.
Part 2: Studying six-center conjugation in phenanthrene
The examples\phenanthrene.fch contains wavefunction of phenanthrene generated at
B3LYP/6-31G* level. The atomic numbering is shown below. In this instance, we will use multicenter bond order to study which six-membered ring has stronger multi-center conjugation effect.

Boot up Multiwfn and input following commands
examples\phenanthrene.fch

9 // Bond order analysis

1,2,3,4,5,6 // Indices of the atoms in the boundary ring. Note that the inputting order must be
in consistency with atomic connectivity, namely inputting such as 1,3,5,6,4,2 will be meaningless
The output is
The multicenter bond order:

0.0593516368

The normalized multicenter bond order:

0.6245570525

Note: It is worth to mention that in this case if you input the atomic indices in reversed order, namely 6,5,4,3,2,1,
the result will be different, namely 0.0591177129. However, since the difference between 0.05935 and 0.05911 is
marginal, we do not discrminate them. More information about influence of input order is mentioned Section 3.11.2

Next, we study the case of the central ring. We input 3,4,8,9,10,7, the result is
The multicenter bond order:

0.0264989378

The normalized multicenter bond order:

0.5460152146

Clearly, the central ring has weaker electron conjugation character than the boundary one,
consequently we can also conclude that the boundary rings have stronger aromaticity. In Section
4.14.3, 4.15.2 and 4.25.6 we will further investigate the ring aromaticity by means of other analysis
methods.
Note that the data of "The normalized multicenter bond order" can be compared between rings
with different number of atoms. Since this value of boundary six-membered ring of phenanthrene
is 0.6245, while that of the boundary three-membered ring of Li6 cluster is 0.4997, we can infer that
the multi-center interaction in the former case may be more prominent.
Part 3: Calculate six-center bond order based on natural atomic orbitals (NAOs)
In Multiwfn, multi-center bond order can also be calculated based on natural atomic orbitals
(NAOs), as introduced in Section 3.11.2. The main advantage of using NAO as basis over the
common case is that reasonable result can still be obtained even diffuse functions are presented.
Here we calculate multi-center bond order in NAO basis for the phenanthrene, in this case
NBO output information with DMNAO keyword is required. The Gaussian input file involved in
this example is exampes\phenanthrene_DMNAO.gjf, the corresponding output file is
examples\phenanthrene_DMNAO.out. As you can see from the .gjf file, the NBO module embedded
in Gaussian is invoked and DMNAO keyword is passed into NBO module.
Boot up Multiwfn and input
examples\phenanthrene_DMNAO.out
9 // Bond order analysis
-2 // Multi-center bond order analysis in NAO basis
1,2,3,4,5,6 // Calculate six-center bond order for the boundary ring
The output is
The multicenter bond order:

0.0588977456

The normalized multicenter bond order:

0.6237584547

As can be seen, the result is almost completely identical to the one we obtained earlier using option
2 in main function 9, it is expected since currently diffuse functions are not employed.

4.9.3 Calculate Laplacian bond order (LBO)
The Laplacian bond order (LBO) was proposed by me in J. Phys. Chem. A, 117, 3100 (2013),
see Section 3.11.7 for detail. LBO is very suitable for organic system and has close correlation with
bonding strength. Let us calculate LBO for C-C bond of ethane, ethene and acetylene.
Boot up Multiwfn and input following commands
examples\ethane.wfn // Optimized and produced at B3LYP/6-31G**
9 // Bond order analysis
8 // Laplacian bond order
You will see the result:
The bond order >=

As you can see, LBO is very close to formal bond order (1.0) for C-C and C-H. LBO only
reflects covalent bonding character, due to C-H is a weakly polar bond, the value is slightly smaller
than 1.0.
Then use examples\ethene.wfn to calculate LBO for ethene

The LBO of the C-C bonds in the three systems are 1.060, 2.022 and 2.767, the ratio is
1:1.907:2.61. It is known that the ratio of the bond dissociation energy (BDE) of the three bonds is
1:1.85:2.61. Clearly, LBO has surprisingly good correlation with BDE, in other words, LBO exhibits
bonding strength fairly well (no other bond order definitions have so close relationship with BDE
in comparison with LBO)
Moreover, LBO predicts that the sequence of the C-H bonding strength in the three systems is
acetylene (0.958) > ethene (0.919) > ethane (0.889), this is completely in agreement with the
experimental BDE sequence! (Other bond order definitions, such as Mayer bond order, fail to
reproduce this sequence)
Finally, calculate LBO for O-H bond in water by using examples\H2O.fch, the result is 0.638.
This value is significantly smaller than the C-H bond order, reflecting that O-H bond is much more
polar than C-H bond.

4.9.4 Decomposition analysis of Wiberg bond order in NAO basis for
formaldehyde
This example briefly illustrates a unique feature of bond order analysis module of Multiwfn,
namely decomposing Wiberg bond order to atomic orbital pair and atomic shell pair contributions.
A very simple molecule formaldehyde will be used as example, of course you can extend the
analysis to much more complicated systems. Please read Section 3.11.8 first to understand basic
idea of this analysis method.
This analysis requires natural atomic orbital (NAO) information and density matrix in NAO
basis outputted by Weinhold's NBO program. For Gaussian user, you can run
examples\H2CO_DMNAO.gjf and use the corresponding output file (examples\H2CO_DMNAO.out)
as input file for this analysis. The orientation of the H2CO molecule in Cartesian system is shown
in below graph.

Boot up Multiwfn and input below command:
examples\H2CO_DMNAO.out
9 // Bond order analysis
9 // Decompose Wiberg bond order in NAO basis
Then you can input two atom indices to obtain their Wiberg bond order calculated under NAO
basis, and meantime obtain major components (the threshold for printing components is controlled
by "bndordthres" parameter in settings.ini). For example, we input 1,4, below result is immediately
shown on screen:

Total Wiberg bond order:

1.9161

From above information, the detail of total Wiberg bond order of 1.9161 becomes quite clear.
According to the molecular graph shown earlier, the px type of NAO corresponds to the 2p atomic
orbital perpendicular to molecular plane, thus the px-px mixing results in  bond, its contribution to
the total bond order (0.9145) is close to unity, which is in line with chemical intuition. The 2s-2s
interaction only has weak contribution to the C=O bond, since the value 0.0823 is almost negligible;
the reason should be attributed to the fact that the orbital overlap is insufficient. In addition, the 2py2py interaction also plays insignificant role, the contribution is merely 0.0658. The interaction
between 2s(C)-2pz(O), 2pz(C)-2pz(O) and 2pz(C)-s(O) have remarkable contribution to total bond
order, which are 0.1907, 0.3700 and 0.2482, respectively, and the sum reaches as high as 0.8089.
The large contributions must mainly stem from good orbital overlapping.
In order to facilitate discussion, the program also outputs contribution to Wiberg bond order
from various atomic shell pairs. For example, as you can see from above information, interaction
between all 2p orbitals of carbon and all 2p orbitals of oxygen totally contributes 1.3504 of bond
order.
In this function you can also input -1 to define two fragments, then contributions from shell
interactions between the two fragments will be given. For example, we want to study the nature of
interaction between the CO fragment and the two H atoms, in the present function you should input
-1 // Decompose interfragment Wiberg bond order
1,4 // Atoms in fragment 1
2,3 // Atoms in fragment 2
Now you can see

Clearly, the CO moiety mainly uses its 2p shells to form covalent bond with the two H atoms,
while 2s shells of this fragment also play a nonnegligible role.

4.9.5 Study orbital contributions to Mulliken bond order for C-C bond
of CH3CONH2
The Mulliken bond order has been introduced in Section 3.11.4, it is also known as Mulliken
overlap population. This kind of bond order is not particularly useful, since it neither correlates well
with bonding strength nor closely related to bond multiplicity. However, a unique advantage is that
it can be exactly decomposed into orbital contributions, and positive and negative value correspond

Total Mulliken bond order:

It can be seen that many MOs have evident positive contributions, such as MO7 (0.303), and
MO10 (0.209); a few MOs have negative contributions, especially MO14 (-0.111). There are also
some MOs have almost vanished contributions, such as MO15 (0.005). Therefore, occupation of
MO7 and MO10 should enhance the strength of the C1-C5 bond, while occupation of MO14 must
be harmful for formation of the C1-C5 bond.
The value of the MO contributions to Mulliken bond order can also be understood in terms of
orbital isosurface map:

For MO7 and MO10, from above graph it can be seen that there is no nodal plane between C1
and C5, the isosurface substantially encloses the C1-C5 bonding region, thus MO7 and MO10 act

as bonding orbital for C1-C5 and have positive contribution to its Mulliken bond order. For MO14,
an evident nodal plane perpendicular to the C1-C5 bond can be clearly seen at the midpoint of C1C5, clearly MO14 behaves as an anti-bonding orbital for C1-C5 bond and thus should have negative
contribution to its Mulliken bond order. For MO15, the C1-C5 bonding region is not covered by the
orbital isosurface, this is why contribution from MO15 to C1-C5 Mulliken bond order is negligible.
Beware that in rare cases the contribution values to Mulliken bond order cannot be well
explained by isosurface map, showing deficiency of definition of Mulliken bond order. In this case
you may try to use the orbital occupancy-perturbed Mayer bond order instead (as illustrated in
Section 4.9.1), which is more robust.
It is noteworthy that decomposition of Mulliken and Mayer bond order can be carried out not
only based on molecular orbitals, but also based on localized molecular orbitals (LMOs), in the
latter case the discussion is usually more meaningful. To do so, in general you should use main
function 19 to yield LMOs and then carry out the decomposition analyses as usual.

4.9.6 Using intrinsic bond strength index (IBSI) to measure strength of
chemical bonds
The intrinsic bond strength index (IBSI) proposed in J. Phys. Chem. A, 124, 1850 (2020) has
certain ability in characterizing strength of covalent bonds, please check Section 3.11.9 for
introduction first. In this section I will illustrate its calculation.
As mentioned in Section 3.11.9, IBSI can be calculated in terms of IGM, IGMH, or mIGM
formalism, they will be referred to as IBSIIGM, IBSIIGMH, IBSImIGM, respectively. To calculate the
IBSIIGM or IBSImIGM, the input file can only contain atom coordinate, while for IBSIIGMH, the input
file must contain wavefunction information. Here we calculate IBSIIGM and IBSIIGMH indices for
acetylene, the .wfn file was generated at B3LYP/6-31G** level, its geometry was optimized at the
same level.
Boot up Multiwfn and input

the IBSI to be calculated is IBSIIGMH

numerical accuracy, while the cost will be correspondingly increased)

Similarly, you can calculate ∫ 𝛿𝑔pair d𝐫 and IBSI for ethane and ethene, their .wfn files
generated at the same level as the C2H2.wfn have been provided as ethane.wfn and ethene.wfn in
"examples" folder. The calculated data of the C-C bond in the three systems are plotted with respect
to their bond dissociation energies (BDEs) in below map, in which the gIGM and gIGMH correspond
to the ∫ 𝛿𝑔pair d𝐫 calculated in terms of IGM and IGMH, respectively.

As can be seen, gIGM does not correlate well with bonding strength, which is directly reflected by
BDE. The linear relationship of the two forms of IBSI and gIGMH is perfect with respect to BDE,
manifesting their great value.
Note that if the input file only contains geometry information, such as .pdb and .xyz, the default
IBSI form to be calculated is IBSIIGM.
Strictly speaking, the reference value of IBSI, namely the denominator in the IBSI expression,
should be calculated at the same level as current system, however in the present example we directly
used the built-in data. You can change it if you hope to obtain more rigorous result, the reference
value can also be evaluated using the present function, see Section 3.11.9 for detail.

4.9.11 Example of using AV1245 and AVmin indices to study
aromaticity

Please read Section 3.11.10 first to gain basic knowledge about the AV1245 and AVmin indices.
In Section 4.9.11.1, AV1245 and AVmin will be employed to distinguish aromaticity between the
two kinds of six-membered rings in phenanthrene, then in Section 4.9.11.2, porphyrin will be taken
as instance to show the ability of these indices in quantification of aromaticity of large rings.

4.9.11.1 Using AV1245 and AVmin to study local aromaticity of phenanthrene
In Section 4.9.2, MCBO has been used to study the difference in local aromaticity for the two
kinds of rings in phenanthrene, whose geometry and atomic numbering are shown below. In this
section, we will use AV1245 and AVmin to study it again.

Namely 1000*AV1245 and 1000*AVmin are 11.171 and 8.015, respectively. The AVmin value
corresponds to 4c-ESI of 3-4-6-1.
Next, we input 3,4,8,9,10,7 to calculate 1000*AV1245 and 1000*AVmin for the central ring,
the result are 5.012 and 3.996, respectively. Clearly, the boundary ring has stronger aromaticity than
the central ring since it has larger AV1245 and AVmin, this conclusion is in line with the MCBO
analysis in Section 4.9.2. In the original paper of AV1245, it is argued that AV1245 behaves as an
approximation of MCBO.
Calculating AV1245 and AVmin in natural atomic orbital (NAO) basis
In Multiwfn, AV1245 and AVmin can also be calculated based on natural atomic orbitals
(NAOs), as mentioned in Section 3.11.10. The main advantage of this way is that reasonable result
can still be obtained even diffuse functions are presented (while if you calculate AV1245 and AVmin
as what we have done earlier when diffuse functions are employed, the result will be quite
misleading)

Here we calculate AV1245 and AVmin in NAO basis for the phenanthrene, in this case NBO
output information with DMNAO keyword should be employed as input. The Gaussian input file
involved in this example is exampes\phenanthrene_DMNAO.gjf, the corresponding output file is
examples\phenanthrene_DMNAO.out. As you can see from the .gjf file, the NBO module embedded
in Gaussian is invoked and DMNAO keyword is passed into NBO module.

As can be seen, the result are almost identical to those we obtained earlier (11.171 and 8.015), this
is expected since currently diffuse functions are not employed.

4.9.11.2 Using AV1245 and AVmin to measure global aromaticity of porphyrin
In this example we use AV1245 and AVmin to quantify aromaticity corresponding to different
delocalization paths of porphyrin. The .fch file generated at B3LYP/6-31G* level can be
downloaded at http://sobereva.com/multiwfn/extrafiles/porphyrin.rar. The structure is shown below.

There are several possible global delocalization paths around the porphyrin, now we calculate
one of them. Although you can manually input atomic indices by tracing atom connectivity as
exhibited in above map, this process is very laborious, especially when the ring under study is large.
It is much better to use GaussView to visually select the atoms in the ring of interest and directly
extract their indices. To do so, we use GaussView to open the porphyrin.fch, then click the brush
icon

, then hold down the left mouse button and let the cursor pass every atom in the ring, then

the atoms will be highlighted as yellow, as shown on the left side of the figure below. After that,
choose "Tools" - "Atom Selection", copy out the atom indices from the text box (see below) to
clipboard, namely 1,3-4,6-8,10-14,16-19,21-22,24.

As you can see, the atomic sequence has been properly recognized, it is fully in line with the actual
connectivity in the ring, therefore the result, 2.76, should be meaningful. The AVmin corresponds
to N3-C6-C12-C14, implying that this local region is the bottleneck of electron delocalization over
the whole path.
Similarly, we calculate AV1245 for other rings by inputting below commands
d
1-2,4-8,10-14,16-20,22-24

1,3-4,6,8-10,12-13,15-16,18-19,21-22,24

It unambiguous that the path passing through nitrogen of pyrroles but bypassing N-H group is the
most favorable delocalization channel, since its 1000*AV1245 and 1000*AVmin values (2.76 and
1.94) are both larger than other pathways. It is worth to mention that for the two paths shown at
bottom of the above map, although their AV1245 are unequal, their AVmin are exactly identical.
This observation suggests that despite average extents of electron delocalization on the two selected
paths are notably different, the bottlenecks are the same.
This system has also been studied in Section 4.4.9 via LOL-, the resulting graph is given
below, from which it can be clearly seen that the degree of electron delocalization along different
paths is significantly different, the top priority delocalized path is vividly revealed by red or orange
color. Obviously the most favorable delocalization path unveiled by AV1245 and AVmin is in good
agreement with that revealed by LOL-.
