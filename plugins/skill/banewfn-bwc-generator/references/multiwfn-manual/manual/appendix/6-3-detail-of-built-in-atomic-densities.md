6.3 Detail of built-in atomic densities
Some analyses, such as Hirshfeld/ADCH population analyses and Hirshfeld orbital
composition analysis request atomic densities. Though, as shown in Section 3.7.3, the atomic
densities can be evaluated based on atomic .wfn files, the process is slightly complicated, namely
the element .wfn files needed must be prepared and sphericalized first. In order to simplify these
analysis tasks, a set of built-in atomic densities (available from H to Lr) was provided in Multiwfn
and one can directly choose to use it.
These built-in atomic densities were evaluated at highly accurate computational level at atom
ground-states, and have been sphericalized (density distribution of many atoms in their ground states
are not spherically symmetric). Main group elements with index <=18 were calculated at B3LYP/ccpVQZ level, those >18 were calculated at B3LYP/ANO-RCC level (except for Ca, UGBS is used
since the ANO-RCC of Ca in EMSL website is wrong, at least when I constructed the densities).
Transition metals were calculated at HF/UGBS level. Lanthanides and Actinides were calculated at
B3LYP/SARC-DKH level (except for U and Np, for which ROHF was used instead of B3LYP
because DFT cannot reproduce their correct ground state configurations). For all elements heavier
than Ar, DKH2 method was employed to take scalar relativistic effect into account. Unless otherwise
specified, open-shell systems were treated by unrestricted open-shell formalism.
The atomic densities are recorded as radial points in atmraddens.f90, the second kind of Gauss-
