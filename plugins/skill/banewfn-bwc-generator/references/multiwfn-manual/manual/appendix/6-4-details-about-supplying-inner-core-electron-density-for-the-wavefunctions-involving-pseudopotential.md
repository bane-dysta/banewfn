6 Appendix
Chebyshev method was used to generate the position of radial points, and the point distribution is
identical for all elements. The atomic density at any point is evaluated in terms of Lagrange
interpolation method based on the points.
If you want to replace built-in atomic density of an element with that calculated yourself, after
booting up Multiwfn and loading corresponding atom wavefunction file, select subfunction 10 in
main function 100 (a hidden option), then Multiwfn will calculate radial electron density and output
the result to sphavgval.txt in current folder. You can directly copy the Fortran codes in this file into
corresponding field of atmraddens.f90.

6.4 Details about supplying inner-core electron density for
the wavefunctions involving pseudopotential
In Section 2.5, the characteristic and the meaning of electron density function (EDF) have been
introduced. EDF information is used to represent the inner-core density replaced by pseudopotential,
so that for the wavefunctions involving pseudopotential, the result of the wavefunction analyses that
purely based on electron density can be almost exactly identical to full-electron wavefunction.
When the input file you used contains GTF information, and meantime some atoms utilized
pseudopotential, Multiwfn automatically finds proper GTF information from built-in EDF library
for these atoms. The built-in EDF library was developed by Wenli Zou and coworkers, it was
originally released as a part of Molden2aim program (https://github.com/zorkzou/Molden2AIM).
The quality of this EDF library is quite good, and is better than the EDF field contained in the .wfx
file produced by Gaussian program. This EDF library covers the entire periodic table, up to index
of 120. For most elements, it contains both EDF information for large and small core
pseudopotentials. Some descriptions about this library posted by its developer can be found in
http://bbs.keinsci.com/thread-5354-1-1.html as well as J. Comput. Chem., 39, 1697 (2018). If you
do not want Multiwfn to read EDF information from this library automatically, set "isupplyEDF" in
settings.ini to 0.
As mentioned in Section 2.5, the .wfx file produced by Gaussian directly carries EDF field
when pseudopotential is used. When this kind of file is used as input, Multiwfn by default reads
EDF information from EDF field of this .wfx file rather than from the built-in EDF library. If you
do not want Multiwfn read EDF information from this file but from the built-in EDF library, you
can change "readEDF" in settings.ini from 1 to 0.
It is noteworthy that Multiwfn also allows reading EDF information from atomic .wfx file
produced by Gaussian rather than from the built-in EDF library of Multiwfn (This feature is rarely
useful, since as mentioned above, the quality of the built-in EDF library in Multiwfn is better than
the EDF library embedded in Gaussian). An example is provided as below:
examples\Pt(NH3)2Cl2.wfn is a file corresponding to Pt(NH3)2Cl2, Lanl2 pseudopotential
accompanied by Lanl2DZ basis set is used for Pt and Cl, while 6-31G* is used for other atoms.
examples\Pt_lanl2.wfx and examples\Cl_lanl2.wfx are the Pt and Cl atomic .wfx files produced by
Gaussian 09, in which Lanl2 is also used, therefore their EDF fields represent the inner-core electron
density of Pt and Cl replaced by Lanl2.
In order to borrow EDF information from the atomic .wfx files in the analysis of
