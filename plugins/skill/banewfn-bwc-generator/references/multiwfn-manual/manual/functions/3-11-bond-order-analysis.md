only removes the arbitrariness of the choice of the threshold, but also guarantees that sum of
oxidation states exactly equal to net charge of present system. In addition, oxidation state of a
fragment in mLOBA is simply the sum of oxidation states of all its constituent atoms. I strongly
suggest using mLOBA instead of LOBA!
The only shortcoming of mLOBA is that when there is (local) geometric symmetry, the result
may be unbalanced. For example, in ethane there is a LMO corresponding to the C-C bond, the two
carbon atoms contribute equally to it. In mLOBA, the two electrons in LOBA may be assigned to
either one of the two carbons, and finally, one carbon has oxidation state of -4 and another one has
oxidation state of -2. The best way of circumventing this issue is defining the two carbons as a
fragment and obtain fragment oxidation state, the result will be -6, and oxidation state of each carbon
should be regarded as -6/2 = -3, which is fully reasonable.
The result of LOBA/mLOBA method somewhat depends on the choice of orbital composition
analysis method. Multiwfn employs Hirshfeld method for LOBA/mLOBA analysis, which is much
more robust than the Mulliken method employed in the original paper of LOBA. So, despite some
papers reported some failure instances of LOBA, most of these instances are not failed in Multiwfn!
Usage
To use this function, you should provide .mwfn, .fch or .molden file recording LMOs (or
NBOs). For example, you can use Multiwfn to carry out orbital localization to generate a
wavefunction file containing LMOs. If you are a Gaussian user, you can use the .fch file resulting
from pop=saveNBO or pop=saveNLMO task as input file to conduct LOBA analysis based on NBO
or NLMO. When LMOs are available in memory, you can enter subfunction 100 of main function
8, then if you input a threshold (e.g. 50), you will obtain oxidation states of LOBA method;
alternatively, if you input m, you will obtain oxidation states of mLOBA method. You can also define
a fragment in the LOBA/mLOBA interface by inputting -1, fragment oxidation state will be printed
together with atomic oxidation states.
An example is given in Section 4.8.4.

3.11 Bond order analysis (9)
In the bond order analysis module, you can directly select an option to analyze bond order by
corresponding method.
If you want to obtain total bond order between atoms in two molecular fragments, you can use
option -1 to define fragments 1 and 2 prior to bond order analysis. Then if you choose an option to
calculate bond order, the total bond order IRS between the two fragments will be calculated as follows
by summing up interatomic bond orders, and meantime be outputted along with two-center bond
orders

I RS =  I AB
AR BS

Evidently, interfragment bond order calculation is not available for multi-center bond order analysis, orbital
occupancy-perturbed Mayer bond order and Wiberg bond order decomposition analysis.

3.11.1 Mayer bond order analysis (1)
The Mayer bond order between atom A and B is defined as (Chem. Phys. Lett, 97, 270 (1983))


I AB = I AB
+ I AB
= 2[(P S)ba (P S)ab + (P  S)ba (P  S)ab ]
aA bB

where P and P are alpha and beta density matrix respectively, S is overlap matrix. Above formula
can be equivalently rewritten using total density matrix P=P+P and spin density matrix Ps=P−P

I AB = [(PS)ba (PS)ab + (PsS)ba (PsS)ab ]
aA bB

For restricted closed-shell circumstance, since spin density matrix is zero, the formula can be
simplified to

I AB =  (PS)ab (PS)ba
aA bB

Generally, the value of Mayer bond order is in agreement with empirical bond order; for single,
double and triple bonds, the values are close to 1.0, 2.0 and 3.0 respectively. For unrestricted or
restricted open-shell wavefunction, alpha, beta and total Mayer bond orders will be outputted
separately. By default, only the bonds whose bond order exceed 0.05 will be printed on screen, the
threshold can be adjusted by “bndordthres” parameter in settings.ini, you can also select to export
full bond order matrix.
Moreover, Multiwfn outputs total and free valences, the former is defined as

VA = 2 ( PS )aa − ( PS )ab ( PS )ba
aA

The latter is defined as

aA bA

FA = VA −  I AB =  (PsS)ab (PsS)ba
B A

aA bA

For restricted closed-shell wavefunctions free valences are zero since Ps=0, thus total valence
of an atom is simply the sum of the related bond orders

V A =  I AB
B A

Total valence (also known as atomic valence) measures atomic bonding capacity, while free valence
characterizes the remaining ability of forming new bonds by sharing electron pairs.
For unrestricted or restricted open-shell system, there is another way to calculate total bond
order rather than summing up alpha and beta bond orders, that is summing up alpha and beta density
matrices to form total density matrix first and then calculate Mayer bond order by using restricted
closed-shell formula, this treatment is sometimes called “generalized Wiberg bond order“, these
total bond orders are printed following the title “Mayer bond order from mixed alpha&beta density
matrix”.
Similar to Mulliken population, Mayer bond order and the multi-center bond order described
below are sensitive to basis set, so do not use the basis sets having diffuse functions, otherwise the
bond order result will be unreliable.
Although Mayer bond order was originally defined for single-determinant wavefunctions, for
post-HF wavefunctions, Multiwfn calculates Mayer bond orders via exactly the same formulae as
shown above based on corresponding post-HF density matrix. The reasonableness of this treatment
has been validated in Chem. Phys. Lett., 544, 83 (2012).

3.11.2 Multi-center bond order analysis (2, -2, -3)
In main function 9 there are three options (2, -2, -3) used to calculate multi-center bond order,
they are very similar and will be introduced below in turn. Finally, a notable point about the input
order of atomic indices is mentioned.

Option 2: Standard multi-center bond order
Multi-center bond index was originally proposed in Struct. Chem., 1, 423 (1990), I prefer to
call it as multi-center bond order (MCBO) because of its very similar form with Mayer bond order.
In some sense MCBO may be viewed as an extension of Mayer bond order to multi-center cases.
Three/four/five/six-center bond orders are defined respectively as

I ABC =  (PS)ab (PS)bc (PS)ca
aA bB cC

I ABCD =   (PS)ab (PS)bc (PS)cd (PS)da
aA bB cC d D

I ABCDE =    (PS)ab (PS)bc (PS)cd (PS)de (PS)ea
aA bB cC d D eE

I ABCDEF =      (PS)ab (PS)bc (PS)cd (PS)de (PS)ef ( PS) fa
aA bB cC d D eE f F

Similarly, infinite-center bond order can be written as

I ABCDEF K = 
aA bB cC

 (PS) (PS) (PS)

kK

ab

bc

(PS)ka

cd

For open-shell cases, there are two definitions of the MCBO, the first one is the sum of alpha
part and beta parts:


I ABCDEF K = I ABCDEF
K + I ABCDEF K


= 2n −1  

Another definition is using the mixed density matrix, this is not rigorous as above:

I ABCDEF K = 

P



= P +P

 (P

For unrestricted or restricted open-shell wavefunction, the output of MCBO analysis consists
of four terms, which have been explained above: (1) The result from alpha density matrix (2) The
result from beta density matrix (3) The sum of the result of alpha and beta parts (4) The result from
mixed alpha&beta density matrix. Commonly, if you are only interested in total MCBO, you should

use (3).
Notice that the MCBO for different number of centers are not directly comparable, since the
result is not in the same magnitude. However, in Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys., 18, 11839 (2016), it was
shown that the normalized MCBO is comparable for different ring size and can be simply calculated
as MCBO1/n, where n is the number of centers. For example, at B3LYP/6-31G* level, the MCBO
for H3+, benzene (6 centers) and naphthalene (10 centers) are 0.2963, 0.0863 and 0.0080,
respectively, while the normalized results are 0.667, 0.665 and 0.617, respectively. When MCBO is
negative, the normalized value will be calculated as -|MCBO|1/n. Commonly, if you need to compare
MCBO between different number of centers, you should take the normalized MCBO from the
information printed by Multiwfn, else using raw MCBO value is suggested.
Multiwfn is able to automatically search multi-center bonds. If you input -3 when Multiwfn
asks you to input atom combination, all three-center bond orders will be calculated, only those larger
than the threshold you inputted will be printed. Similarly, four-, five- and six-center bonds can be
searched by inputting -4, -5 and -6 respectively. Due to efficiency consideration, the search may be
not exhaustive. Also note that the search is based on mixed alpha&beta density matrix for openshell cases.
There is a hidden option -3 in main function 9, it is used to calculate MCBO under Löwdin
orthogonalized basis. The only difference between this option and the option 2 described above is
that this option performs Löwdin orthogonalization for basis functions before calculating the MCBO.
Since this method does not have obvious advantage over the standard MCBO definition, this option
is rarely used and thus invisible in the interface. However, if you have interesting, you can have a
try.

Option -2: Multi-center bond order in natural atomic orbital (NAO) basis
The most severe drawback of the MCBO is its high basis set dependency. In particular, if
diffuse functions are presented, then MCBO result may be misleading or completely meaningless.
In order to tackle this problem, I proposed an alternative way (to be published) to calculate the
MCBO, and the idea is implemented as option -2.
Option -2 is very similar to option 2 (as introduced above), the only difference is that the
MCBO is calculated based on natural atomic orbital (NAO) basis rather than based on the basis
functions originally defined by the basis set. Since NAO is an orthonormal set and thus overlap
matrix S is an identity matrix, the formula can be simplified as (using closed-shell form for example)

I ABCDEF K = 
aA bB cC

P P P

kK

ab bc cd

Pka

The MCBO calculated in this manner has very good stability with respect to change in basis
set. Even if diffuse functions are presented the result is still fully reliable. According to my
experience, if no basis function shows diffuse character, the results given by option 2 and -2 will be
very similar, though not exactly identical.
In order to use option -2, the output file of NBO module embedded in Gaussian or standalone
NBO program (namely GENNBO) should be used as input file, and DMNAO keyword must be used
to make NBO print density matrix in NAO basis. If you are a Gaussian user, for example, you can
use output file of below instance as input file of Multiwfn (DO NOT use .fch file for this analysis!).

In this function, if you only input indices of two atoms, then the result is just Wiberg bond
order under NAO basis, which is completely identical to that printed by bndidx keyword of NBO
program.

Influence of input order of atomic indices on the result
Both the direction (e.g. A,B,C,D vs. D,C,B,A) and permutation (e.g. A,B,C,D vs. B,D,C,A ...)
of the inputted atomic indices can influence the calculated MCBO, below I describe this point in
detail.
• Input direction
Due to the mathematical form of the original MCBO (i.e. the one calculated by option 2), the
result of MCBO may relies on input direction. For example, the result yielded by inputting A,B,C,D
can be different from that by inputting D,C,B,A. The reason is clear: The term corresponding to
A,B,C,D is (PS)ab(PS)bc(PS)cd(PS)da, while if we invert the input order, the term will become
(PS)dc(PS)cb(PS)ba(PS)ad. Although both P and S are symmetry matrices, their product PS is not
necessarily symmetry, so the two terms are not equivalent. In my own viewpoint, in order to obtain
more reasonable result, if in a ring the atom connectivity is A-B-C-D-E-F (A also connects to F),
one should calculate A,B,C,D,E,F and F,E,D,C,B,A respectively and then take their average. If you
want Multiwfn to directly prints the averaged value, you can set "iMCBOtype" in settings.ini to 1,
in this case you do not need to manually perform the calculation twice, however, of course, the
computational cost is doubled compared to normal case.
An advantage of using option -2 to calculate MCBO in NAO basis and using option -3 to
calculate it in Löwdin orthogonalized basis is that the result is irrelevant to the input direction, this
is because in these cases the overlap matrix S is not explicitly involved and the density matrix P is
a symmetry matrix.
• Index permutation
Permutation of inputted atomic indices in the calculation of MCBO can significantly alter the
result. For example, the result of inputting 1,2,3,4,5,6 may be very different to that of inputting
2,4,3,5,6,1, regardless of which form of MCBO is used. If your aim is to study aromaticity and
characterize cyclic delocalization of electrons over a ring, you should input the atomic indices in
clockwise or anti-clockwise order, or take their average as mentioned above.
Some people advocated that it is needed to take all possible permutations into account to get a
definitive result, see J. Phys. Org. Chem., 18, 706 (2005); that means for a region consisting of six
atoms, the bond order of (B,C,A,D,E,F), (C,A,B,D,E,F), (D,B,C,A,F,E) and so on (6!=720 in total)
are all required to be taken into account. This definition became known as multi-center index (MCI)
in Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys., 18, 11839 (2016). An explicit definition is given below, see Eq. 9 of
Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys., 18, 11839 (2016):

MCI =

1
 I A,B,C...
2n Pˆ ( A, B ,C ...)

where n is the number of atoms involved in the calculation, 𝑃̂ is permutation operator that generates
all possible permutation sequences. The MCI is significantly more expensive than the MCBO, and
it is not suitable for measuring aromaticity or cyclic delocalization. However, it may be useful in
measuring "global" electron delocalization among atoms in a cluster-like region.
If you want to make Multiwfn directly print MCI, you can set "iMCBOtype" in settings.ini to
2, then if you calculate MCBO as usual (via any of options 2, -2 and -3), the printed result will
correspond to MCI.
Finally, it is worth to note that MCBO may be marginally negative in some cases. If you did
not employ diffuse functions, or the MCBO was calculated based on NAOs, then you can simply
view the very small negative MCBO as zero. For three-center cases, if MCBO is an evident negative
value, then it is implied that there is a three-center four-electron (3c-4e) interaction (e.g. CO2).

Appendix: The extremely efficient implementation of MCBO in Multiwfn
According to the expression, the computational cost of MCBO seems to increase exponentially
with the increase of the number of atoms in the ring, making its evaluation infeasible for large rings.
Thanks to the special implementation of MCBO proposed by me, the cost of MCBO in Multiwfn
grows only linearly with number of ring members. The computational time is negligible even for a
ring consisting of many dozens of atoms! The algorithm is described as follows.
Five-center MCBO is taken as an example here, whose original definition is

I ABCDE =    ( PS ) ab ( PS )bc ( PS )cd ( PS ) de ( PS )ea
aA bB cC d D eE

which can be reformulated as

I ABCDE =  ( PS ) ab  ( PS )bc  ( PS )cd  ( PS ) de ( PS )ea
aA bB

cC

d D

eE

If an intermediate matrix A is fully calculated and stored in memory, whose element is
expressed as

Ad ,a =  ( PS )de ( PS ) ea
eE

,

then MCBO can be simplified to

I ABCDE =  ( PS )ab  ( PS )bc  ( PS )cd Ad ,a
aA bB

cC

d D

Next, if an intermediate matrix B is fully calculated and stored in memory, whose element is
expressed as

Bc ,a =  ( PS )cd Ad ,a
d D

then MCBO can be simplified to

I ABCDE =  ( PS )ab  ( PS )bc Bc ,a

Furthermore, if an intermediate matrix C is fully calculated and stored in memory, whose
element is expressed as

Cb,a =  ( PS )bc Bc ,a
cC

,

then MCBO can be finally simplified to

I ABCDE =  ( PS )ab Cb,a
aA bB

It is clear that using the intermediate matrices A, B, C, MCBO can be evaluated in a quite
simple manner, while construction of A, B, C is also very cheap. The formal cost of this
reformulation of MCBO only increases linearly with number of atoms, and thus can be easily
applied for a ring even consisting of more than 100 atoms.
In order to prove the correctness and the significant value of the special implementation of
MCBO in Multiwfn, a comparison of the results and time consumption for calculating MCBO1/n of
cyclo[n]carbon system at B97XD/def2-TZVP level is given below. In the table, “old” denotes the
direct programming based on the original equation of MCBO, which was conducted using Multiwfn
3.6 (in which the current algorithm has not been available), “current” denotes the algorithm
described above. Intel i9-13980HX CPU was used for the test. It can be seen that the two algorithms
give exactly the same result, however the cost of the “old” algorithms is already high for
cyclo[8]carbon (even using a small basis set like 6-31G*, MCBO usually can at most be used for a
ring containing a dozen atoms). In contrast, the current algorithm can exactly calculate MCBO of
cyclo[48]carbon only within 1 second!

3.11.3 Wiberg bond order analysis in Löwdin orthogonalized basis (3)
Wiberg bond order is defined as follows, see footnote in Tetrahedron, 24, 1083 (1968)

The original definition of Wiberg bond order is only suitable for the wavefunction represented
by orthogonal basis functions such as most of semiempirical wavefunctions, and only defined for

restricted closed-shell system. Actually, Mayer bond order can be seen as a generalization of Wiberg
bond order, for restricted closed-shell system and orthonormal basis functions (namely S matrix is
identity matrix) cases their results are completely identical.
In this function, Multiwfn first orthogonalizes basis functions by Löwdin method and then
performs usual Mayer bond order analysis. The threshold for printing is controlled by “bndordthres”
in settings.ini too.
As shown in J. Mol. Struct. (THEOCHEM), 870, 1 (2008), the Wiberg bond order calculated
in this manner, say WL, has much less sensitivity to basis set than Mayer bond order (whereas for
small basis sets, their results are closed to each other). One should be aware that WL tends to
overestimate bond order for polar bonds in comparison with Mayer bond order.
Commonly, if there is not special reason, using Mayer bond order is more preferred.
Notice that numerous literatures used NBO program to calculate Wiberg bond order, the result
must be somewhat different to that produced by present function, because in NBO program the
Wiberg bond orders are calculated in the basis of natural atomic orbitals (NAO), which are generated
by OWSO orthogonalization method. Multiwfn is also possible to calculate Wiberg bond order
under NAO basis, and furthermore, the result can be decomposed as atomic orbital pair contributions,
see Section 3.11.8 for details.

3.11.4 Mulliken bond order analysis (4) and decomposition (5)
Mulliken bond order is the oldest bond order definition, it is defined as

I AB = i  2Ca ,iCb,i Sa ,b = 2 Pa ,b Sa ,b
i

aA bB

aA bB

Mulliken bond order has low agreement with empirical bond order, it is deprecated for
quantifying bonding strength, for which Mayer bond order always performs better. However,
Mulliken bond order is a good qualitative indicator for bonding (positive value) and antibonding
(negative value). The threshold for printing results is controlled by “bndordthres” parameter in
settings.ini.
Mulliken bond order is easy to be decomposed to orbital contributions, the contribution from
orbital i to bond order AB is
i
I AB
= i  2Ca ,iCb,i Sa ,b

From the decomposition, we can know which orbitals are favourite and unfavourable for
specific bonding.

3.11.5 Orbital occupancy-perturbed Mayer bond order (6)
Orbital occupancy-perturbed Mayer bond order was firstly proposed in J. Chem. Theory
Comput., 8, 908 (2012). Put simply, by using this method one can obtain how large is the

contribution from specific orbital to Mayer bond order.
Orbital occupancy-perturbed Mayer bond order can be written as
,
,
I A ,B = I AB
+ I AB
= 2[(PX S)ba (PX S)ab + (PX S )ba (PX S )ab ]
aA bB

The only difference between this definition and Mayer bond order shown in Section 3.11.1 is that
𝛽

P and P have been replaced by 𝐏𝑋𝛼 and 𝐏𝑋 respectively. PX stands for the density matrix generated
∗
when occupation number of a specific orbital is set to zero. The difference between 𝐼𝐴,𝐵
and Mayer
bond order can be regarded as a measure of contribution from the orbital to Mayer bond order. Bear
∗
in mind, because Mayer bond order is not a linear function of density matrix, the sum of 𝐼𝐴,𝐵
for all
orbitals is not equal to Mayer bond order generally.
∗
In Multiwfn, you only need to input indices of two atoms, then 𝐼𝐴,𝐵
for all occupied orbitals
∗
and the difference between 𝐼𝐴,𝐵 and Mayer bond order will be outputted. The more negative
(positive) the difference, the more beneficial (harmful) to the bonding due to the existence of the
orbital.
∗
You can also use another way to calculate 𝐼𝐴,𝐵
, that is using wavefunction modification module
(main function 6) to manually set occupation number of a specific orbital to zero, and then calculate
∗
Mayer bond order as usual, but this manner may be tedious if you want to calculate 𝐼𝐴,𝐵
for many
orbitals.
This kind of analysis is illustrated in Section 4.9.1 and Section 4.19.3.

3.11.6 Fuzzy bond order (7)
Fuzzy bond order (FBO) was first proposed by Mayer in Chem. Phys. Lett., 383, 368 (2004):


BAB = BAB
+ BAB
= 2[(P S A ) (P S B ) + (P  S A )  (P  S B ) ]




A
S
=  wA (r )   (r )  (r)d r

where S is overlap matrix of basis functions in fuzzy atomic spaces. In Multiwfn, Becke's fuzzy
atomic space with sharpness parameter k=3 in conjunction with modified CSD radii is used for
calculating FBO. (See Section 3.18.0 for introduction of fuzzy atomic space).
Commonly the magnitude of FBO is close to Mayer bond order, especially for low-polar bonds,
but much more stable with respect to the change in basis set. According to the comparison between
FBO and delocalization index (DI) given in J. Phys. Chem. A, 109, 9904 (2005), FBO is essentially
the DI calculated in fuzzy atomic space. See Section 3.18.5 for detail about DI.
Calculation of FBO requires performing Becke's DFT numerical integration, due to which the
computational cost is larger than evaluation of Mayer bond order. By default, 40 radial points and
230 angular points are used for numerical integration. This setting is able to yield accurate enough
results in general. If you want to further refine the result, you can set the number of radial and
angular points by "radpot" and "sphpot" in settings.ini manually, and ensure that "iautointgrid" has
been set to 0.
The threshold for printing results is controlled by “bndordthres” parameter in settings.ini.

3.11.7 Laplacian bond order (8)
In J. Phys. Chem. A, 117, 3100 (2013) (http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jp4010345), I
proposed a novel definition of covalent bond order based on the Laplacian of electron density ∇2 𝜌
in fuzzy overlap space, called Laplacian bond order (LBO). The LBO between atom A and B can be
simply written as

LA,B = −10 

 w (r)w (r)  (r)d r
2

A

B

2   0

where w is a smoothly varying weighting function proposed by Becke and represents fuzzy atomic
space, hence wAwB corresponds to fuzzy overlap space between A and B. Note that the integration
is only restricted to negative part of ∇2 𝜌. The physical basis of LBO is that the larger magnitude the
integral of negative ∇2 𝜌 in the fuzzy overlap space, the more intensively the electron density is
concentrated in the bonding region, and therefore, the stronger the covalent bonding.
In the original paper of LBO, the reasonableness and usefulness of LBO were demonstrated by
applying it to a wide variety of molecules and by comparing it with many existing bond order
definitions. It is shown that LBO has a direct correlation with the bond polarity, the bond
dissociation energy and the bond vibrational frequency. The computational cost of LBO is low, also
LBO is insensitive to the computational level used to generate electron density. In addition, since
LBO is inherently independent of wavefunction, one can in principle obtain LBO by making use of
accurate electron densities derived from X-ray diffraction data.
In Multiwfn, Becke's fuzzy atomic space with sharpness parameter k=3 in conjunction with
modified CSD radii is used for calculating LBO. (See Section 3.18.0 for detail about fuzzy atomic
space). The threshold for printing results is controlled by “bndordthres” parameter in settings.ini.
Note that in current implementation, LBO is particularly suitable for organic system, but not
for ionic bonds since in these cases a better definition of atomic space should be used to faithfully
exhibit actual atomic space. LBO is also not very appropriate for studying the bond between two
very heavy atoms (heavier than Ar), because these bonds are often accompanied by insignificant
charge concentration in the fuzzy overlap space, even though the bonding is doubtless covalent.
A good application example of LBO is Carbon, 165, 468 (2020), in which LBO was employed
to characterize the bonding between two different kinds of C-C bonds in cyclo[18]carbon.

3.11.8 Decompose Wiberg bond order in NAO basis as atomic orbital
pair contributions (9)
Theory
As mentioned in Section 3.11.3, Wiberg bond order is expressed as

I AB =  Pab2
aA bB

--- page break ---

3 Functions
The data is calculated for atomic pair. Since the expression is simply a linear combination of square
of density matrix element, it is straightforward to decompose Wiberg bond order as basis function
pair contribution (this idea is to be published). For example, Pab2 is simply the contribution from
interaction between basis functions a and b. Since one-to-one correspondence between basis
function and atomic orbital is lacking when extended basis set is used, in order to make the
decomposition method full of physical meaning, the decomposition is best to be carried out under
natural atomic orbitals (NAOs). Each non-Rydberg type of NAO uniquely corresponds to an atomic
orbital, thus, by above decomposition method, Wiberg bond order at the atomic orbital scale can be
obtained.
In addition, contribution from interaction between atomic orbital shells i and j can be obtained
as

 P .

ashell i bshell j

2
ab

By the way, it is also possible to decompose multi-center bond order as atomic orbital
contribution. For example, three-center bond order is expressed as

I ABC =  Pab Pbc Pca
aA bB cC

Clearly, PabPbcPca can be regarded as the contribution from interaction between NAOs a, b and c.
However, decomposition of multi-center bond order under NAO basis has not been implemented.
Usage
After entering this function, simply input indices of two atoms, the nonnegligible contribution
from NAO pairs and NAO shell pairs together with total Wiberg bond will be printed.
You can also input -1 to input atom indices to define two fragments, then NAO shell
contributions between the two fragments to the interfragment Wiberg bond order will be given.
The input file of this function is completely identical to the option -2 described in Section
3.11.2, namely the output file of NBO program containing density matrix information (i.e.
"DMNAO" keyword is required).
An illustrative example of this decomposition analysis is given in Section 4.9.4.

3.11.9 Intrinsic bond strength index (IBSI) (10)
Theory
The intrinsic bond strength index (IBSI) was proposed in J. Phys. Chem. A, 124, 1850 (2020)
to quantify strength of chemical bonds, it may also be used to compare strength of weak interactions.
The IBSI was originally defined in the framework of independent gradient model (IGM), which is
very detailedly described in Section 3.23.5. The IBSI is expressed as

IBSI =

(1 / d 2 )   g pair d r

(1 / d H2 2 )   g H 2 d r

where d is the distance between the two atoms for which the interaction is to be studied. The integral
in the numerator is equivalent to the atomic pair g index defined by me between the two atoms,
see Section 3.23.6 for detail. The denominator is the data for reference system, the 𝑑H2 and the

129

3 Functions
integral are the bond length and atomic pair g index of H2 in its equilibrium structure, respectively.
In the original paper of IBSI, it was shown that the IBSI value is modestly positively correlated with
strength of covalent bond. Furthermore, it was found that magnitude of IBSI of transition metal
coordinate bond is markedly smaller than that of covalent bond, and magnitude of IBSI of weak
interactions is even much lower, this feature of IBSI may be used to distinguish type of interaction.
Implementation
It is important to note that in the IBSI paper the authors calculated the IBSI using the IGM
based on gradient-based partition (IGMGBP), however this form of IGM is not supported by
Multiwfn. Currently Multiwfn supports the original form of IGM, namely IGM based on
promolecular approximation (IGMpro), and also supports IGM based on Hirshfeld partition of
molecular density (IGMH), as well as mIGM. Different forms of IGM correspond to different ways
of evaluating gradient of atomic density, and thus the value of the integral in the IBSI expression is
correspondingly different. In Multiwfn, the IBSI can be computed based on IGMpro, IGMH, and
mIGM, their results are very different, I found the result based IGMpro is obviously closer to the
original paper of IBSI.
Usage
To calculate IBSI, you simply need to enter main function 9 and select subfunction 10, then
select option 0 to start calculation.
Before calculation, Multiwfn asks you to choose quality of integration grid, evidently the better
the grid, the higher the cost, while the more accurate the result. According to my experience, for
IGMpro, "medium quality" is already able to give quantitatively accurate result; while for IGMH and
mIGM, at least "high quality" should be used if you have requirement on accuracy.
You can choose which form of IGM will be used in the IBSI calculation by option 2. If the
input file contains wavefunction information, by default IGMH is used, while if the input file only
contains geometry information (e.g. .pdb, .mol, .xyz...), IGMpro or mIGM can be used. Note that
IGMH is much more expensive than IGMpro, since its formula to evaluate gradient of atomic density
is much more complicated.
If you are only interested in the interactions in a local region, you can choose option 3 to define
the region to be studied, only the IBSI between the atoms in the defined fragment will be evaluated
and outputted, the cost is correspondingly lower than the IBSI calculation for the whole system,
especially when the system is huge.
The reference value can be set by option 4, it corresponds to the denominator of the IBSI
formula. Of course, this value must be different for IGMpro, IGMH, and mIGM. The default
reference values were calculated for H2 with experimental bond length (0.74144 Å), in the IGMH
case B3LYP/6-311G** wavefunction was employed. Commonly, the reference value is not needed
to be changed. However, for calculating IBSI in terms of IGMH, if you want to obtain the reference
value at your current calculation level to pursue stricter result, you can load wavefunction file of H2,
then enter the present function, set reference value to 1.0, then use option 0 to start to calculate IBSI,
the result can be employed as reference value for studying practical molecules.
In order to avoid excessive output, by default only the data for the atomic pairs with separation
smaller than 3.5 Å are printed, because IBSI should be negligible if the separation is larger. If you
need to adjust the distance printing threshold, use option 5.
Example of calculating IBSI is given in Section 4.9.6.

3.11.10 AV1245 index (approximate multi-center bond order for large
rings) and AVmin
Theory
The multi-center bond order (MCBO), as introduced in Section 3.11.2, is a very rigorous and
popular way of characterizing aromaticity. In Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys., 18, 11839 (2016), the
authors proposed the AV1245 index to quantify aromaticity for large rings, it can be regarded as an
approximation of MCBO.
The original key advantage of AV1245 over MCBO is that the computational cost of AV1245 only increases
linearly with number of atoms, while the cost of MCBO is usually prohibitively high for a ring composed of more
than 11~12 atoms. However, since Multiwfn 3.8, the computational time of MCBO also becomes linearly
proportional to ring members and thus MCBO can be easily employed for very large rings, the value of AV1245
becomes much less obvious.

The definition of AV1245 in the original paper is "average all the 4c-ESI values along the ring
that keeps a positional relationship of 1, 2, 4, 5". Here I clarify its definition. As an instance, for
below ring,

its AV1245 is calculated as
AV1245=[ESI(1,2,4,5)+ESI(2,3,5,6)+ESI(3,4,6,1)+ESI(4,5,1,2)+ESI(5,6,2,3)+ESI(6,1,3,4)] / 6
where the nc-ESI (n-center electron sharing index) can be directly obtained via the multi-center
bond order with all possible permutations (namely I perm, see Section 3.11.2 for detail) by below
relationship

ESI =

2
I perm
(n − 1)!

where n is the number of atoms. Evidently, 4c-ESI = (4c-Iperm) / 3.
The central idea of AV1245 is based on the fact that in an aromatic ring, the resonance between
1-2 bond and 4-5 bond is strong, as illustrated below. This feature can be captured by ESI(1,2,4,5).

Larger value of AV1245 of a cyclic path implies stronger delocalization and thus larger
aromaticity of the ring. Since magnitude of AV1245 is small, it is often multiplied by 1000 when
presenting the data.
It is worth to note that in the original paper of AV1245, the MCBO was calculated in terms of

131

atomic overlap matrix under AIM partition, this way of calculation is not only expensive but
complicated. In Multiwfn, the MCBO involved in the AV1245 is calculated in usual way, namely
based on density matrix and overlap matrix. Since in this case the calculation of 4-center I perm is
fairly cheap, the AV1245 can be quickly obtained even for large systems and macro-rings. However,
due to the difference in the calculation of MCBO, the result of AV1245 produced by Multiwfn is
smaller than that in the original paper. In addition, when directly calculating AV1245 by Multiwfn
(in other words, calculating AV1245 in original basis functions), the employed basis set should not
contain diffuse functions, otherwise the AV1245 will be meaningless.
Multiwfn also supports calculating AV1245 in natural atomic orbital (NAO) basis, in this case
reasonable result can be obtained even if diffuse functions are presented. If there is no diffuse
function, the result calculated in original basis functions and that in NAO basis is nearly the same.
The AVmin index was proposed in J. Phys. Chem. C, 121, 27118 (2017) and further discussed
in Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys., 20, 2787 (2018). It corresponds to minimal absolute value of all 4cESIs involved in the calculation of AV1245. Unlike AV1245, AVmin quantifies lowest degree of
conjugation in the whole pathway, therefore it has unique value in distinguishing aromaticities of
different delocalization pathways, since according to common intuition, aromaticity of a path should
be predominated by the local region mostly disconnecting the delocalization over the whole path.
In other words, AVmin is able to determine the bottleneck of aromaticity of a given path.
Usage
• Calculating AV1245 and AVmin in original basis functions
You should enter subfunction 19 of main function 200, then input indices of the atoms in the
ring in the order of connectivity (clockwise or counterclockwise along the ring). After that, the
AV1245 together with its constituent 4c-ESI values as well as AVmin will be outputted
Multiwfn provides a convenience for inputting the atomic indices for large rings. If you input d first and press
ENTER button, then you can input the atomic indices in arbitrary order, because in this case the actual order will be
automatically guessed according to interatomic connectivity. However, this input mode cannot be used when any
atom in the ring connects to more than two other atoms in the ring.

• Calculating AV1245 and AVmin in NAO basis
The operation process is the same as "Calculating AV1245 and AVmin in original basis
functions", however, you should use output file of standalone NBO program or the NBO module
embedded in quantum chemistry codes as input file of Multiwfn, and meantime the "DMNAO"
keyword must be employed in the NBO analysis. Note that in this case the aforementioned "d" mode
of index inputting is not available.
Examples of employing AV1245 and AVmin to study aromaticity of small rings and large rings
are given in Section 4.9.11.
