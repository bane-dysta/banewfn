Usage
The DOS module of Multiwfn also supports plotting COHP between fragments or between
nearest atoms. To plot COHP, you should do the following steps
(1) Load a wavefunction file containing basis function information such as .mwfn, .fch
or .molden file, see Section 2.5.
(2) Enter DOS plotting module (main function 10), and choose option “-7 Change to COHP
plotting mode”.
(3) Now Multiwfn asks you to provide Kohn-Sham matrix. You can directly let Multiwfn to
generate it based on wavefunction information, or load it from an external file, see Section 6.7 for
details.
(4) If you want to plot COHP between nearest atoms, simply choose option 0. If you want to
plot COHP between two fragments, you should define two fragments in option -1 first and then
choose option 0. Note that the interface for defining COHP fragments is exactly the same as that for
defining PDOS fragments.
(5) Now Multiwfn calculates COHP between nearest atoms or between fragments for every
MO in the plotted energy range, then broadens them as a curve and show it on screen.
(6) The post-processing menu of plotting COHP is very similar to that of plotting DOS.
However, there is a dedicated option “-2 Show COHP raw data and ICOHP”, by which you can let
Multiwfn print COHP values of all MOs in the COHP map, so that you can quantitatively compare
COHP data between different situations. The sum of COHP values of the occupied levels in the map
is also printed, which may be used to assess contribution of the MOs to interatomic or interfragment
bonding.
An example of plotting COHP is given in Section 4.10.7.

3.13 Plotting IR, Raman, UV-Vis, ECD, VCD, ROA and
NMR spectra (11)
Multiwfn has a very powerful and flexible module to plot IR (Infrared), normal Raman / Preresonance Raman, UV-Vis (ultraviolet-visible), ECD (electronic circular dichroism), VCD
(vibrational circular dichroism) and Raman optical activity (ROA) spectra, see Sections
3.13.1~3.13.4 for introduction. Many examples of plotting various kinds of spectra are given in
Section 4.11.
Multiwfn is also able to plot NMR spectrum, see Section 3.13.5 for introduction and Section
4.11.10 for examples.
For vibrational spectra, Multiwfn is able to decompose them to gain insight into their nature,
this is known as partial vibrational spectrum (PVS), which will be described in Section 3.13.6,
relevant examples are given in Section 4.11.12.
Multiwfn can exactly predict color based on theoretical or experimental UV-Vis spectrum, see
Section 3.12.7 for introduction and 4.11.14 for example.

3.13.1 Theory
For comparing theoretical results with experimental spectrum, the discrete lines corresponding
to each transition mode have to be broadened to emulate the situation in real world, the commonly
used broadening function for vibrational spectra (IR, Raman, VCD and ROA) is Lorentzian function,
while for electronic spectra (UV-Vis and ECD), Gaussian function is often used, see Section 3.12.1
for details. Unlike DOS graph, in which the strengths for each energy level are always simply set to
1.0 (namely broadened curves from each energy level are normalized to 1.0), the strengths of
transitions are very important data for plotting spectrum.
The unit of transition energy of IR, Raman, VCD and ROA spectra is cm-1 in common, for UVVis and ECD spectra all of eV (1 eV=8.06551000 cm-1), nm and 1000 cm-1 are common units. The
strength data of each transition mode outputted by quantum chemistry programs is proportional to
the area under the broadened curve. Below we discuss some details of the six types of spectra
supported by Multiwfn respectively.
IR: The frequently used unit of molar absorptivity , namely L(molcm)-1, can be rewritten as

L
1000cm3 1000cm2
=
=
mol  cm mol  cm
mol
Since IR intensity  =

  ( ) d , where  is transition frequency, the unit of  should be
1000 cm2
1000 cm 0.01 km
(cm −1 ) =
=
mol
mol
mol

However, km/mol is the more commonly used unit for IR intensity, therefore if IR intensity of a
vibrational mode is p km/mol, then the broadened curve from which should be normalized to 100*p
(in the other words, the area under the curve is 100*p). Sometimes the unit esu2cm2 is used for IR
intensity, the relationship with km/mol is 1 esu2cm2 = 2.5066 km/mol.
Below is an example of IR spectrum plotted by Multiwfn. Notice that the left axis corresponds
to the curve (artificially broadened data), the right axis corresponds to the discrete lines (original
transition data).

Raman (normal or pre-resonance): Raman spectrum measures intensity of scattered light.
Beware that for a specific vibration mode i, its Raman activity Si and Raman intensity Ii are two
different quantities. Raman activity is an intrinsic property of each molecular vibrational mode,
while Raman intensity is directly related to experimental Raman spectrum, and its value is
dependent of the choice of wavenumber of incident light 0 as well as temperature. The conversion
relationship can be found in many literatures, for example my paper Chem. Asian J., 16, 56 (2021)
DOI: 10.1002/asia.202001228 gave it and you can cite:

C ( 0 − vi ) 4 Si
Ii =
 i Bi

 hc i 
Bi = 1 − exp  −

 kT 

where C is a suitably chosen common normalization factor for all peak intensities, i is vibrational
frequency. Only the Raman spectrum broadened based on Raman intensities is strictly comparable
to the experimental one; however, as the peak position of Raman activity and intensity are identical,
and for a specific vibrational mode its intensity is proportional to its activity, the Raman spectrum
broadened from Raman activities is also useful in some sense.
Almost all quantum chemistry codes only output Raman activities, therefore by default,
Multiwfn emulates the Raman spectrum in terms of broadening Raman activities. However, you can
also let Multiwfn to first convert the activities to intensities via option 19 (v0 and T are provided by
users) based on above formula, then the Raman spectrum will be obtained by broadening Raman
intensities. The normalization coefficient C is fixed to 10-12 in Multiwfn (which is unimportant since
what we are interested in is the shape rather than the absolute height of Raman spectrum). The
integral of the peak broadened by one unit of Raman activity or intensity is equal to 1.
UV-Vis: In theoretical chemistry field, oscillator strength (f) is used for representing the
transition strength involved in UV-Vis spectrum, which is defined as

fij =

2
( E j − Ei ) | μij |2
3

where i and j stand for initial and final states, and they correspond to ground state and excited state

in the context of UV-Vis spectrum, respectively. E is energy of state. |ij|2 is squared norm of
transition electric dipole moment vector between the two states.
There is a relation between theoretical data and experimental spectra: If the unit 1000 cm-1 and
L/mol/cm are used for X-axis and Y-axis respectively, then the area under the curve that broadened
from per unit f should be 1/4.32*106. Equivalently, if eV is used as X-axis unit, the value should be
1/4.32/8.0655*106=28700. Via this relation, UV-Vis spectrum can be simulated by theoretical data.
Fluorescence spectrum can also be plotted with exactly the same manner as UV-Vis, the only
difference to UV-Vis is that according to Kasha's rule, you should only take the first singlet excited
state (S1) into account, and geometry of optimized S1 state should be used (however, note that some
systems break Kasha’s rule). For plotting phosphorescence spectrum, you should only take the first
triplet excited state (T1) into account, and geometry of optimized T1 state should be used. Note that
in order to obtain non-vanishing f corresponding to phosphorescence emission, spin-orbit coupling
effect must be taken into account.
Directional UV-Vis: The |ij|2 mentioned above can be written as sum of its three Cartesian
2

components, namely |𝛍𝑖𝑗 | = (𝜇𝑖𝑗
) + (𝜇𝑖𝑗
) + (𝜇𝑖𝑗
) . The so-called directional UV-Vis spectrum

in Multiwfn refers to the case of only taking contribution of specific components of |ij|2 into account.
You can choose to plot X, Y, Z, X+Y, X+Z, Y+Z or specific direction type of the spectrum. For
2

2

2

𝑋
𝑌
example, if you plot X+Y type, then the |𝛍𝑖𝑗 | will be replaced with (𝜇𝑖𝑗
) + (𝜇𝑖𝑗
) , and the

resulting spectrum will only exhibit the absorption due to interaction between present system and
the electric field oscillating in X and Y directions. If you manually define the direction as (1,0,1),
which corresponds to normalized vector of (

), then |𝛍𝑖𝑗 | = (

𝜇𝑖𝑗
) +(

) . Clearly,

directional UV-Vis spectrum is very helpful in understanding the nature of optical absorption in
terms of interaction with oscillating electric field of specific direction(s). In contrast, common UVVis spectrum corresponds to the case that the incident oscillating electric field is isotropic. Note that
directional UV-Vis spectrum is additive, for example, sum of X and Y and Z types of the spectrum,
and sum of X+Y and Z types of the spectrum, all equivalent to common UV-Vis spectrum.
ECD：The significance of rotatory strengths in ECD spectrum is analogous to oscillator
strengths in UV-Vis spectrum, each electron transition mode corresponds to a rotatory strength. If
the rotatory strengths are broadened, after somewhat scaling and shifting, the resultant curve will be
comparable to experimental ECD spectrum. The integral of the peak broadened by one unit of
rotatory strength is equal to 1. In quantum chemistry programs, such as Gaussian, rotatory strengths
can be calculated in length representation or in velocity representation, in the former case the
strengths are origin-dependent, while in the latter case the strengths are origin-independent. For
complete basis set situation, the results in the two representations converge to the same values.
Commonly velocity representation is recommended to be used.
VCD: VCD measures difference in molecular absorption coefficient of left- and rightcircularly polarized lights at different wavenumber , namely VCD curve can be expressed as
∆𝜀() = 𝜀L () − 𝜀R (). Each vibrational mode has a rotatory strength, after broadening rotatory
strengths of all vibrational modes, the shape of the resulting curve can be compared with
experimental VCD spectrum. The integral area under the curve ∆𝜀() contributed by a vibrational
mode is proportional to its rotatory strength.

ROA: The ROA spectrum measures the difference between scattering intensity of right and
left circularly polarized light:

ROA intensity  I iR − I iL 

( 0 − vi ) 4 Ai
 i Bi

 hc i 
Bi = 1 − exp  −

 kT 

The ROA strength data outputted by Gaussian ROA task in fact is the Ai term, which should be
converted to actual ROA intensity according to above equation. The Ai term is dependent of
frequency of incident light. The integral of the peak broadened by one unit of ROA intensity/strength
is equal to 1. There are several different forms of ROA, including ROA SCP(180), ROA SCP(90),
ROA DCP(180). The 90 and 180 denote the angle between incident light and scattered light. The
SCP (scattered circular polarization) means the incident light is linearly polarized light while the
scattered light is circularly polarized light; DCP (dual circular polarization) corresponds to the case
that both incident and scattered lights are circularly polarized light. The ROA SCP(180) is
commonly employed, and it is also known as SCP backscattered ROA.
The ROA task of Gaussian also simultaneously outputs frequency-dependent Raman strength,
which corresponds to the Ri term of below equation

( 0 − vi ) 4 Ri
Raman intensity  I + I 
 i Bi

 hc i 

correspondingly, there are also Raman SCP(180), Raman SCP(90) and Raman DCP(180) data.
Since the current used incident light should be far from electron excitation energy, such Raman
spectrum is called as far from resonance Raman.

3.13.2 Input file
Only the input files mentioned in this section are supported by Multiwfn for plotting spectrum
purpose. DO NOT use such as .fch, .molden and .wfn as input file, evidently the data needed for
plotting spectrum are not recorded in these files.
1 Gaussian output file
• IR spectrum: Use output file of freq task as input. If you use Gaussian 09 D.01 or later
revisions and meantime freq=anharm keyword was specified to carry out anharmonic analysis,
Multiwfn will prompt you to choose if loading anharmonic frequencies and IR intensities instead of
the harmonic ones.
• Raman spectrum: Use output file of freq=raman task as input. If you would like to plot preresonance Raman spectrum, you should at the same time use CPHF=rdfreq keyword and write the
frequencies of the incident lights after a blank line under the geometry specification, e.g. 300nm
400nm 500nm. If you hope to plot anharmonic Raman spectrum, use freq(raman,anharm) keywords,
then Multiwfn will prompt you to choose if loading anharmonic frequencies and Raman activities
instead of the harmonic ones.
• VCD spectrum: Use output file of freq=VCD task as input. If you hope to plot anharmonic
Raman spectrum (supported by Gaussian since G16), use freq(VCD,anharm) keywords, then
Multiwfn will prompt you to choose if loading anharmonic frequencies and rotatory strengths
instead of the harmonic ones.

145

3 Functions
For anharmonic IR, Raman and VCD spectra, you can choose if only loading anharmonic
fundamental data, or simultaneously loading anharmonic overtone band or combination band data.
• UV-Vis, directional UV-Vis and ECD spectrum: Use output file of TDDFT, TDHF, CIS,
ZINDO or EOM-CCSD task as input, no additional keywords are required. The rotatory strengths
in both length and velocity representation (the data under "R(length)" and "R(velocity)",
respectively) can be chosen to be loaded by Multiwfn. Output file of optimization task for excited
state can also be used, only the last output for transition information will be loaded by Multiwfn,
therefore the resulting spectrum corresponds to final geometry.
• ROA spectrum: Use output file of freq=ROA task as input. The frequencies of incident lights
should be specified after a blank line under the geometry specification, e.g. 0.02, 0.03, 0.04, 0.05,
the unit is default to a.u.; or write e.g. 500nm 520nm 550nm.
2 ORCA output file
• IR spectrum: Use freq keyword.
• Raman spectrum: Use keywords like below
! b3lyp def2-SVP numfreq
%elprop Polar 1 end
• UV-Vis, directional UV-Vis and ECD spectrum: Commonly TDDFT is used, example of
keywords:
! b3lyp def2-SVP
%tddft
nroots 20
TDA false
end
Notice that for TDDFT calculation, ORCA by default uses Tamm-Dancoff Approximation
(TDA), in this case the oscillator strength and rotatory strengths are evidently not as good as those
produced by TDDFT, therefore in above example TDA false is used to make ORCA use standard
TDDFT formalism. Also it is worth noting that ORCA employs length representation for rotatory
strengths in ECD.
Output file of sTDA or sTD-DFT task of ORCA (see below for details) is also supported by
Multiwfn for plotting (directional) UV-Vis or ECD spectrum purpose. Below are example keywords:
! PBE0 def2-SVP def2/J RIJCOSX
%maxcore 6000
%pal nprocs 36 end
%tddft
Mode sTDDFT
Ethresh 10.0
maxcore 6000
end
Since ORCA 4.1 spin-orbit coupling (SOC) effect can be taken into account during TDDFT
calculation, and all data needed for plotting SOC corrected UV-Vis and ECD spectra are
automatically outputted. Therefore, when output file of SOC-TDDFT task is loaded into Multiwfn,
when you enter UV-Vis and ECD plotting option, you can select if loading SOC corrected data
instead of the one without SOC consideration. It is very easy to conduct SOC-TDDFT, simply
adding dosoc true in %tddft section, for example:

%tddft nroots=40 TDA false dosoc true end
Output file of CIS, TDHF, ZINDO, EOM-CCSD, (DLPNO-)STEOM-CCSD calculations can
also be used as input file for simulating (directional) UV-Vis and ECD spectra in Multiwfn.
• VCD: Output file of regular frequency analysis task with %freq doVCD true end setting.
• ROA spectra: Currently not supported by ORCA.
3 Grimme's sTDA output file
The sTDA proposed by Grimme in J. Chem. Phys., 138, 244104 (2013) is a method
approximately solve the TDDFT equation and thus reduces the computational cost of the electron
excitation part of TDDFT calculation by about two or three orders of magnitude. The corresponding
sTDA program can be freely downloaded at https://github.com/grimme-lab/stda.
Although the Grimme's sTDA code has already been implanted into ORCA program, the
tda.dat file outputted by standalone sTDA code can also be used as input file of Multiwfn for plotting
UV-Vis or ECD purpose.
When ECD is to be plotted, you can choose which representation of rotatory strength will be
used. The length and velocity representations have been mentioned above, while the mixed-form of
representation, which is recommended in the sTDA original paper, is defined as RM= RV  fL / fV,
where fL and fV are length and velocity representations of oscillator, respectively, and RV is the
velocity representation of rotatory strength.
4 Grimme's xtb output file
The xtb program written by Grimme is mainly used to carry out GFN-xTB calculation (J. Chem.
Theory Comput., 13, 1989 (2017) and J. Chem. Theory Comput., 15, 1652 (2019)), which may be
viewed as a semiempirical variant of DFT method. It is not only robust but also rather fast, it can be
conveniently applied to systems consisted of hundreds of atoms. Note that although the accuracy of
xtb frequency has been verified to be basically reasonable, the quality of IR intensities outputted by
xtb is not quite satisfactory (according to my experiences). xtb program can be freely obtained via
https://github.com/grimme-lab/xtb/.
By running xtb test.xyz --ohesst, xtb will optimize the structure in test.xyz and then perform
frequency analysis. The vibspectrum outputted in the current folder contains harmonic frequencies
and IR intensities, it can be used as input file of Multiwfn for plotting IR spectrum purpose.
5 CP2K output file
Output file of vibrational analysis task of CP2K can be used as input file for plotting IR and
Raman spectra. INTENSITIES T should present in &VIBRATIONAL_ANALYSIS. In addition, for
plotting IR, the following content should present in &DFT:

In addition, if you request CP2K to export .mol (Molden) file containing vibrational modes and
IR intensities by adding the following content to &VIBRATIONAL_ANALYSIS field, then the .mol

using following content in &TDDFPT section, then spin-orbit coupling corrected UV-Vis spectrum
can be plotted.

X-adsorption spectrum may be plotted by Multiwfn based on .spectrum file produced by
&XAS_TDP task of CP2K. You need to manually reorganize the data in the .spectrum to the plain
text file, as shown below.
Note that CP2K input file of aforementioned tasks can be easily generated by corresponding
option in subfunction 2 of main function 100.
6 BDF output file
Output file of TDDFT task of BDF can be used as input file for plotting UV-Vis spectrum.
7 Plain text file
For generality, Multiwfn supports plain text file as input, you can extract transition data from
output files of computational chemistry packages other than the aforementioned ones, and then fill
them into a file according to the format shown below
numdata inptype

where numdata denotes how many entries in this file. If inptype is set to 1, then only energy and
strength will be read, and FWHMs for all transitions will be automatically set. If inptype is set to 2,
then FWHMs will be read too. The transitions should be sorted according to the energies from low

to high. The unit of both energy and FWHM should be in cm-1 for IR, Raman, VCD and ROA spectra,
in eV for UV-Vis and ECD spectra. The unit of strength should be in km/mol, Å4/amu, cgs (10-40
erg-esu-cm/Gauss), 10-44 esu2 cm2, 104 K for IR, Raman, ECD, VCD, ROA spectra, respectively
(oscillator strength of UV-Vis is dimensionless).

3.13.3 Usage and options
After boot up Multiwfn, first input path of output file of aforementioned programs or the plain
text file containing transition data, then enter main function 11, and you will be asked to select the
type of spectrum (for pre-resonance Raman and ROA, you also need to choose the frequency of
interest), after that you will see below options. The meaning of some options may be different for
various types of spectra.
Note that in this interface you can input s anytime to save current plotting settings to a file, or
input l to load plotting settings from a file, so that you can quickly recover plotting status.
-4 Set format of saving graphical file: This is used to choose the format of the graphical file
exported by option 1. Commonly, using vector format such as ps, pdf and svg is recommended.
-2 Export transition data to plain text file: Output energies, intensities and FWHMs of all
transitions to transinfo.txt in current directory, this file fully complies with the format introduced in
last section, so it can be directly used as input file.
-1 Show transition data: Print energy and intensity data of all transitions on screen.
0 Plot spectrum: Plot spectrum right now! The spectrum will be shown on screen, and
meantime the minima and maxima of the spectrum curve will be shown in console window.
1 Save graphical file of the spectrum in current folder: As the title says.
2 Export X-Y data set of lines and curves to plain text file: Export X-Y data set of lines and
broadened spectrum to spectrum_line.txt and spectrum_curve.txt in current directory, respectively,
you can replot the curve and discrete line graph directly by the two files via external program, such
as Origin.
3 Set lower and upper limit of X-axis: As the title says. The interval between ticks also needs
to be inputted. By default, the range of X-axis is adjusted automatically according to minimum and
maximum transition energies.
4 Set left Y-axis: Set starting value, ending value and step size for left Y-axis. By default, the
range of Y-axis is adjusted automatically according to the maximum peak.
5 Set right Y-axis: Like option 4, but for right Y-axis.
In many cases, after you adjusting setting for Y-axis at one side, the position of zero point of
this Y-axis deviates from that of Y-axis at another side, which makes the graph weird; To address
this problem, options 4 and 5 enable you to choose if correspondingly adjusting range of Y-axis at

149

3 Functions
another side. If you input y, then lower/upper limit and label interval of Y-axis at another side will
be proportionally scaled to make zero point of left and right Y-axes are in the same horizontal line.
6 Select broadening function: Gaussian, Lorentzian and Pseudo-Voigt function can be
selected for broadening discrete lines as curves.
7 Set scale ratio for curve: If the value is set to k, then the height of curve will multiply k in
full range. For Raman, ECD, VCD and ROA spectra the default value is 1.0, for IR the value is 100,
for UV-Vis spectrum an empirical value 28700.0 is used when energy unit is eV or nm, when unit
is 1000 cm-1 the value 1/(4.32*10-6) is used.
8 Input full width at half maximum (FWHM): As the title says.
9 Toggle showing discrete lines: Choose if show the discrete lines corresponding to transitions
on the spectrum graph.
10 Switch the unit of infrared intensity / Set the unit of excitation energy: For IR spectrum,
switch the unit of IR intensities between km/mol (default) and esu2*cm2. For UV-Vis and ECD
spectra, choose the unit of energies between eV, nm and 1000 cm-1.
11 Set Gaussian-weighting coefficient: Sets wgauss, which is mentioned in Section 3.12.1, this
option only appears when Pseudo-Voigt function is chosen.
12 Set shift value in X: If the value is set to k, then the final curve and discrete lines will be
shifted by k in X direction.
13 Set colors of curve and discrete lines: As the title says.
14 Set scale factor for transition energies (or vibrational frequencies): The selected
transition energies (or vibrational frequencies) will be scaled by a given factor when drawing
spectrum. This is option is mainly used to apply frequency scaling factor onto the theoretically
calculated harmonic frequencies.
15 Output contributions of individual transitions to the spectrum: If select this option, user
will be prompted to input a criterion (e.g. k), then not only the total spectrum (as option 2), but also
the contributions from the individual transitions whose absolute value of strength larger than k will
be outputted to spectrum_curve.txt in current folder. This feature is particularly useful for identifying
the nature of total spectrum.
In this function you can also input 0 first, then input a X position of the spectrum, then 10
transitions having largest contribution to this position will be shown, this is quite convenient to make
clear major contributors at specific spectrum positions (e.g. peak positions of important absorptions).
16 Set status of showing labels of spectrum minima and maxima: You will enter an interface,
in which there are many options used to set how to show spectrum minima and maxima on the
plotted map, they are self-explanatory.
17 Other plotting settings: Miscellaneous plotting settings can be set here, such as if showing
dashed grid lines, if showing labels on axes, text size of axis name / ticks / legends, number of
decimal places in axes, type of labels in left Y-axis, position of legends, set color of line and curve
of different systems.
18 Toggle weighting spectrum of each system: See explanation in next section.
19 Convert Raman (or ROA) activities to intensities: As mentioned earlier, this option is
used to convert Raman (or ROA) activities to intensities. After that, the Raman (or ROA) spectrum
plotted by option 0 will be the one broadened based on Raman (or ROA) intensities rather than
Raman (or ROA) activities. The wavenumber of incident light and temperature are inputted by users.
20 Modify strengths: You can select some transitions and change their strengths (depending

150

on spectrum type) to specific value. This option is very useful if you would like to plot fluorescence
spectrum, in this case you need to set oscillator strength of all transitions except for the lowest
singlet excitation to zero (Kasha's rule).
21 Set status of showing weighted curve and curves of individual systems: As shown in the
next section, Multiwfn is able to plot weighted spectrum according to given weights of multiple
systems. This option controls if plotting weighted curves and curves of various systems.
22 Set thickness of curves/lines/texts/axes: As the title says.
23 Set status of showing spikes to indicate transition levels: Via this option, you can plot
one or multiple sets of spikes at bottom of the spectrum to indicate position of different sets of
transitions. If some transitions are degenerate, the height of spikes can be used to reflect degree of
degenerate. See Section 4.11.9 for illustration of this option. This option is not available when
multiple systems are considered in the plotting simultaneously.
Note that the actual number of points constituting the spectrum is controlled by "num1Dpoints"
parameter in settings.ini. The default value is commonly large enough and thus need not to be
adjusted.

3.13.4 Plotting multiple systems together and weighted spectrum
In Multiwfn, it is possible to simultaneously plot spectrum for multiple files, and meantime
taking weights into account. This feature is quite useful for obtaining actual spectrum of flexible
molecule with many thermally accessible conformations.
For example, there is a molecule containing four accessible conformations, their distribution
ratio has been determined according to Boltzmann's method based on calculated free energies. If
you want to plot its weighted spectrum and spectrum of each conformation, you should write a plain
text file named multiple.txt (other file name cannot be recognized by Multiwfn), the content is:
boltz\Excit\a.out 0.6046
boltz\Excit\b.out 0.1950
boltz\Excit\c.out 0.1686
boltz\Excit\d.out 0.0317

where the first and second column correspond to path of input file and weight of each conformation.
Different type of input file can be presented together in this file. If you use this file as input file,
after you entered spectrum plotting module, Multiwfn will load data from these files in turn. When
plotting spectrum, spectrum of all the four conformations will be separately calculated and drawn
with different colors. In addition, the weighted spectrum is plotted on the graph as thick red curve,
it is simply evaluated as follows:
weighted spectrum = 0.6046a + 0.1950b + 0.1686c + 0.0317d
In the graph you can also observe many black discrete lines, these are collection of discrete lines
corresponding to different conformations. Notice that their heights have already been multiplied by
corresponding weights.
If before plotting spectrum you have chosen option 18 once, then the spectrum of various
conformations shown on graph are the weighted ones; in other words, these curves represent
contribution of each conformation to actual spectrum (thick red curve). In this case, the color of
weighted discrete lines is no longer all black but in accordance with color of curves, so that user can

151

--- page break ---

3 Functions
easily recognize correspondence between curve and discrete among different systems.
If you simply want to simultaneously plot spectrum for multiple systems but do not want to
draw weighted spectrum, then the second column of multiple.txt should not be weights, but
customized legends, for example
boltz\Excit\a.out Molecule A
boltz\Excit\b.out Molecule B
boltz\Excit\c.out Molecule C
boltz\Excit\d.out Molecule D

Then plot spectrum as usual, curve of all the four systems will be shown together, and the legends
will be "Molecule A", "Molecule B", etc.
When the legend is completely composed of numbers, the legend will be regarded as weight. If the legends
have to be a number, you should add $ in front of the legend to let Multiwfn know it is legend rather than weight.
For example, $50 will be recognized as legend of “50”.

If you are using Linux platform and some file paths in the multiple.txt contains / symbol or
space, you should add double quotation marks at the two ends of the file path, so that the path could
be properly loaded.

3.13.5 Plotting NMR spectrum
Theory
Many quantum chemistry programs are able to compute magnetic shielding tensors  at nuclei,
usually only the average of its diagonal terms, namely isotropic magnetic shielding value iso, is of
interest, because NMR spectrum is commonly determined in solvent environment and the solute is
able to freely rotate.
The chemical shift  is calculated as follows

 ref − 
=
  ref − 
ref
1−
where ref is shielding value of reference substance (tetramethylsilane for 13C and 1H NMR), while
the  is shielding value of the sample to be determined. The two values should be evaluated at
exactly the same calculation setting (theoretical method, basis set, solvation model...).
Another way of determining chemical shift is scaling method, see http://cheshirenmr.info for
detail. Briefly speaking, this method evaluates  in a very simple way:
 = a  + b
where the a and b are prefitted slope and intercept parameters based on a training set for specific
calculation level. For example, if the optimization is conducted under vacuum using B3LYP/6-31G*
while shielding value is calculated using B3LYP/6-31G* under chloroform environment represented
by SMD solvation model, then a = -1.0157 and b = 32.2109 for 1H NMR, while a = -0.9449 and b
= 188.4418 for 13C NMR.
If there are methyl groups in the system, the  of its three hydrogens should be averaged before
generating NMR spectrum, since methyl groups can freely rotate in actual environment due to its
extremely low rotation barrier. In addition, if there are multiple thermally accessible conformers and
they can interconvert with each other easily, the weighted average shielding value should be
calculated for each atom based on weights of the conformers:

152

--- page break ---

3 Functions

 A =  pi iA
i

where i is conformer index and A is atom index. pi stands for weight of conformer i, which can be
calculated according to Boltzmann distribution based on relative free energies between the
conformers.
With  of all atoms in hand, one can plot discrete line map of NMR, the X-axis of the spikes
in the map corresponds to  while Y-axis corresponds to degeneracy, which is N if maximal spacing
between N chemical shifts is less than specific threshold (e.g. 0.05 ppm), for other cases the
degeneracy is 1.0.
Actual NMR spectrum with finite peak width can be generated by broadening the spikes by
Lorentzian function, the full width at half maximum (FWHM) is a key parameter of controlling peak
shape. In this curve map, the peak height corresponds to strength of NMR signal.
Input file
Output file of NMR task of Gaussian, ORCA and BDF programs are directly supported as input
file for plotting NMR spectrum. .data file generated by NMR task of CP2K can also be used.

• Plain text file
Plain text file recording atom names and shielding values can also be used as input file for
plotting NMR spectrum, see examples\spectra\NMR\general.txt for example. Thus in principle
Multiwfn can plot NMR for any program that can yield shielding values.
Usage
After loading input file, entering main function 11 and selecting NMR, you will see the NMR
plotting interface. Then if you select option 0, NMR spectrum will be displayed, and raw data will
be shown on console window. Since most options in this interface are self-explanatory, only a few
noteworthy options are mentioned below.
• -2 Export NMR data to a plain text file: This option exports shielding values to
NMRdata.txt in current folder. If you have used option 7 to convert shielding values to chemical
shifts, then both of them will be exported.
• 6 Choose the element considered in plotting: Via this option you can choose the element
to be considered. For example, if you want to plot 1H NMR spectrum or examine relevant data, you
should select this option and input H.
• 7 Set how to determine chemical shifts: By default, the X-axis in the plotted NMR spectrum
corresponds to magnetic shielding value, while if want to make chemical shift  as X-axis, you
should select this option prior to plotting. In this option you can select the way of determine :
(1) Taking difference between shielding value of current system and reference system. You can
manually input reference value or directly use built-in data.
(2) Using scaling method to determine the . you can manually input the fitted slope and
intercept, or directly use built-in data.
There are several sets of built-in data, they correspond to the levels very suitable for calculating
.
• 10 Average shielding values of specific atoms: For example, usually the  of the hydrogens
in the same methyl group should be averaged, you can use this function to realize this purpose.
• 11 Set strength of specific atoms: By default, every atom has strength of 1.0, namely
contributes to degeneracy by 1.0. You can use this option to modify strength of specific atoms. For
example, if you set strength of atoms 3, 6, 7 to 0, then these atoms will disappear in the plotted
spectrum.
• 16 Change setting of labelling atoms: In order to distinguish the atoms in the NMR spectrum,
Multiwfn labels atomic indices on the plotted peaks. You can use this option to control details of
labelling, such as position, size, color, content of the labels and so on.
Plotting conformation weighted spectrum and spectrum containing multiple systems
Conformation weighted NMR spectrum can be plotted by using plain text file as input (the
name must contain "multiple", for example, valine_multiple.txt is a valid name), each line contains
path of an input file and corresponding conformation weight, for example:

154

--- page break ---

3 Functions
D:\valine\conf1.out 0.43
D:\valine\conf2.out 0.25
D:\valine\conf3.out 0.32

If you simply want to plot NMR spectrum of multiple systems together, specifying file path
and legend in each line, for example
/lovelive/nico.out Isomer 1
/lovelive/nozomi.out Isomer 2

Then after entering NMR plotting interface, you can plot the spectrum via exactly the same
steps as plotting single system. Note that all systems must have the same number of atoms.
Special notes
To save the NMR spectrum as graphical file, you can choose option 1. It is highly suggested to
use pdf format, because it is a vectorial format, the spectrum can be losslessly zoomed in and out,
and the lines and texts look very smooth. The format can be chosen by option -3, and the default
format can be changed by "graphformat" in settings.ini.
After adjusting various plotting settings, you can input s in the interface to save plotting settings
to a specific text file, so that when you want to replot the NMR spectrum with exactly the same
effect in the future, you can input l to directly restore plotting settings from the text file. Note that
any operation on plotted data must be manually redone every time (e.g. averaging shielding values,
converting shielding values to chemical shifts, etc.).
Some examples of plotting NMR spectrum are given in Section 4.11.10.

3.13.6 Partial vibrational spectrum (PVS) and partial vibrational
density-of-states (PVDOS)
The partial vibrational spectrum (PVS) were proposed by me to intuitively understand nature
of peaks of vibrational spectra. Partial vibrational density-of-states (PVDOS) is closely related to it.
In this section I will describe their definition and implementation in Multiwfn.

3.13.6.1 Theory
PVS and PVDOS
Recall that vibrational spectrum curve can be represented as follows

 ( E ) = c fi G ( E − Eivib )
i

where c is a constant depending on type of vibrational spectrum, i loops over all vibrational modes,
f and Evib respectively correspond to strength (e.g. IR intensity for IR spectrum, rotatory strength for
VCD spectrum) and transition energy of a vibration mode, and G is broadening function (usually
Lorentzian function for vibrational spectrum).
PVS method decomposes the total vibrational spectrum as contributions from different
fragments. The PVS curve of fragment A is expressed as

 A ( E ) = c iA fi G( E − Eivib )
i

155

--- page break ---

3 Functions
where Θ𝐴𝑖 is composition of fragment A in vibrational mode i.
Vibrational density-of-states (VDOS) represents density of vibrational transitions per
wavenumber, which is represented as

 ( E ) = c G( E − Eivib )
i

The coefficient c and the unit of VDOS are arbitrary, only relative magnitude of VDOS at different
energies is of interest. The partial VDOS (PVDOS) curve of fragment A is expressed as

 A ( E ) = c iAG( E − Eivib )
i

Type of fragment
In Multiwfn, maximally 10 fragments can be defined simultaneously to draw their PVS or
PVDOS curves. The fragment(s) can be defined in two ways:
(1) A set of atoms. Their all Cartesian coordinates or specific Cartesian components (i.e. X, Y,
Z, XY, XZ, or YZ) can be taken into account.
(2) A set of redundant internal coordinates (RIC). The RICs may be bonds, angles and dihedrals,
and they are allowed to be mixed in a fragment.
Composition of fragment in vibrational modes
The way of calculating Θ𝐴𝑖 is not unique. Each vibration mode has two key characters, normal
coordinate and intensity, so Θ𝐴𝑖 can be defined as percentage contribution of fragment A to either of
them of vibrational mode i, as described below.
Composition type 1: Percentage contribution to normal coordinate
Normal coordinate q of each vibrational mode represents motion of 3Natom atomic Cartesian
coordinates {x} involved in the vibration. Let Lj,i represent component of xj in qi, and assume that qi
is normalized, then Θ𝐴𝑖 is defined as

iA = 100%   L2j ,i
jA

where j loops over all or specific Cartesian coordinates of atoms in fragment A.
Composition type 2: Percentage contribution to intensity
This type of composition is much more complicated than the composition type 1, and currently
is only applicable to IR intensity. IR intensity of vibrational mode i is expressed as

where s is a constant factor, and  stands for Cartesian component  of electric dipole moment of

dipole moment derivative to atomic Cartesian coordinates and corresponding components of normal
coordinates:

Note that the Θ𝐴𝑖 defined in above way could be slightly negative or larger than 100% in some
cases, this is unavoidable and never means the result is incorrect. Negative value comes from the
fact that the interfragment coupling contribution may be negative, whose magnitude can even be
greater than the always positive intrafragment contribution.
Summary of type of fragment spectrum
Taking all information described above, now we can define different forms of spectrum
representing fragment contribution to vibration modes, the following ones are currently supported
in Multiwfn:

PVS-NC(atom)

PVS-NC(RIC)

PVS-I(atom)

PVDOS-NC(atom)

PVDOS-NC(RIC)
The meaning of PVS and PVDOS is clear. “I” and “NC” mean that the composition of fragment
in a vibrational mode are defined as fragment contribution to its intensity and normal coordinate,
respectively. (atom) and (RIC) denote that the fragments are composed of a set of atoms (and may
be some of their Cartesian components) and redundant internal coordinates, respectively.
As mentioned earlier, PVS-I(atom) can only be used for decomposition analysis of IR spectrum,
while PVS-NC(atom/RIC) can be used to decompose any kind of vibrational spectrum. PVDOS is
independent of type of vibrational spectrum, because it does not involve strength information.
Different types of spectrum have different practical values. For example, from PVS-NC(atom)
you can intuitively recognize which atoms mainly participate in active vibration modes in different
wavenumber ranges, while PVS-NC(RIC) allows you to study this in terms of internal coordinate

157

3 Functions
motions. Via PVS-I(atom), you can vividly understand which atomic motions in vibrations make a
notable contribution to IR absorption intensity at different wavenumbers. Spectral inactive
vibrational modes cannot be visually studied by means of PVS-NC or PVS-I spectra, however, one
can respectively utilize PVDOS-NC(atom) and PVDOS-NC(RIC) to easily understand which atoms
and internal coordinates are significantly involved in vibration modes lying in different energy
regions.
Overlap PVS (OPVS) and overlap PVDOS (OPVDOS)
In order to visually study coupling effect of atomic motions of different two fragments in
vibrational spectrum, I defined OPVS and OPVDOS, which are respectively expressed as

 AB ( E ) = c iAB fi G( E − Eivib )
i

 AB ( E ) = c iAB G ( E − Eivib )
i

𝑖
where A and B are the two fragments for which you want to study their coupling effect, Θ𝐴𝐵
is their
percentage coupling contribution to vibrational mode i.
𝑖
For overlap PVS-NC (OPVS-NC) and overlap PVDOS-NC (OPVDOS-NC), Θ𝐴𝐵
is defined as

iAB = 100%  2  min(iA , iB )
𝑖
If mode i is equally contributed by fragments A and B, namely Θ𝐴𝑖 = Θ𝑖𝐵 = 50%, then Θ𝐴𝐵
= 100%.
At a wavenumber, the closer the OPVS-NC (𝜀𝐴𝐵 ) curve to  curve, or the close the OPVDOS-NC
(𝜌𝐴𝐵 ) curve to  curve, the more the spectrum at this wavenumber exhibits the collective motion of
fragments A and B.
𝑖
𝑖
𝑖
For overlap PVS-I (OPVS-I) spectrum, Θ𝐴𝐵
is defined as 100% × 𝐼𝐴𝐵
/𝐼 𝑖 , where 𝐼𝐴𝐵
is
coupling contribution of fragments A and B to vibration mode i:
i

I AB

 = x, y,z

The more positive (negative) the OPVS-I curve, the more the IR absorption is enhanced (suppressed)
by the interfragment coupling effect.

3.13.6.2 Usage
To plot the spectrum curves contributed by fragments introduced above, after booting up
Multiwfn, you need to load input file for plotting common vibrational spectrum, then enter main
function 11, select the type of the vibrational spectrum you want to plot, including IR, Raman, VCD
or ROA (PVS-I only supports IR. For VDOS, all of them are equivalent). Then, after choosing
option “24 Set partial vibrational spectra (PVS) or vibrational DOS (VDOS)”, you will enter an
interface for defining fragments and adjusting relevant plotting settings. As you can see from screen,
by inputting t, you can select the type of the fragment spectrum. By inputting a number, you can
define fragment of corresponding index, please carefully follow the prompts on screen, at most 10
fragments can be defined. If you have defined two or more fragments, you can then use option 0 to
choose two fragments for which the OPVS or OPVDOS curve will be plotted.
Once defining fragments has finished, you can input q to leave the interface, and at the same
time, Multiwfn will load needed data from input file and generate composition of various fragments
in every vibrational mode, and the quantitative result will be shown on screen. (For PVS-I, you will

158

also be asked to input the .fch/fchk file produced by “freq” task of Gaussian, from which Multiwfn
will load data needed for calculating IR intensities. At the same time, Multiwfn asks you if
outputting IRinten.txt file, which contains very detailed raw and intermediate information about IR
intensity evaluation, which is particularly helpful for you to understand source of 𝐼𝐴𝑖,𝜎 )
After leaving option 24, you can plot vibrational spectrum as usual by choosing option 0, the
PVS/OPVS or VDOS/OPVDOS curves will be displayed together with vibrational spectrum curve.
Note that for plotting Raman or ROA spectrum together with accompanied PVS-NC curves,
you need to convert Raman activities to Raman intensities first as usual.
Input file
• PVS-NC(atom) and PVDOS-NC(atom): You can use output file of frequency analysis of
Gaussian, ORCA, and CP2K programs as input file.
xtb program is also supported but the situation is slightly special: After performing Hessian
calculation task by xtb, you will have vibspectrum and g98.out files. After booting up Multiwfn you
should load the vibspectrum, and after defining fragments and leaving the interface of option 24,
you will be asked to input the path of the g98.out, from which Multiwfn will load normal coordinates.
• PVS-NC(RIC) and PVDOS-NC(RIC): You should use output file of frequency analysis of
Gaussian as input file. freq=intmodes keyword of Gaussian must be used, so that composition of
RICs in various vibrational modes will be written to Gaussian output file, which will be loaded by
Multiwfn when leaving option 24.
• PVS-I(atom): You should use output file of frequency analysis of Gaussian as input file, and
the .fch/fchk file converted from the .chk file produced by this task must be kept, which is requested
to be provided by Multiwfn when leaving option 24.
Examples of plotting (O)PVS and (O)VDOS are given in Section 4.11.12.

3.13.7 Predicting color based on UV-Vis spectrum curve
Multiwfn provides a very useful and powerful function to predict color of a chemical substance
based on its UV-Vis adsorption spectrum curve. Very detailed explanation can be found in my blog
article “Predicting color of chemical substances through quantum chemistry calculations and
Multiwfn program” (http://sobereva.com/662, in Chinese), here only key information is given.
Theory
A chemical substance displays a color if it has optical adsorption in visible light range, and the
displayed color corresponds to the reflection and transmission lights. Essentially, the displayed color
is the complementary color with respect to the color corresponding to the UV-Vis adsorption
spectrum (i.e. adsorption color). In order to convert the UV-Vis spectrum to the displayed color, the
following steps are needed:
(1) Calculate X, Y, Z values of CIE1931 XYZ color space based on CIE1931 2 tristimulus
functions (tabulated data given in literature) and the UV-Vis spectrum generated in usual way. See
https://www.oceanopticsbook.info/view/photometry-and-visibility/chromaticity for details.
(2) Convert X, Y, Z values to R, G, B values of sRGB color space via linear transformation.
See https://www.oceanopticsbook.info/view/photometry-and-visibility/from-xyz-to-rgb for details.
Note that Gamma correction is not used.

159

--- page break ---

3 Functions
(3) If any of R, G, B values exceeds valid range of sRGB color space, scale it into valid range,
namely [0,1].
(4) Take complementary color of the color corresponding to the adsorption light as (1.0-R,1.0G,1.0-B).
(5) Obtain maximum brightness colors of the adsorption color and its complementary color by
respectively shifting their maximum components to 1.0, so that the two colors have equal brightness.
Now, the maximum brightness of complementary color can be regarded as the color actually
displayed by the chemical substance.
Note that Multiwfn not only reports R, G, B components of adsorption color and
complementary color in [0,1], but also reports in [0,255] range.
Usage
There are two ways of using Multiwfn to predict color
• Case 1: Predicting color directly based on the theoretical UV-Vis spectrum generated by
Multiwfn
In this case, the input file is the same as that for plotting UV-Vis spectrum as described in
Section 3.13.2. After loading input file, enter main function 11, select option “25 Evaluate color
based on the spectrum in visible range”, then UV-Vis spectrum within 360-830 nm will be first
shown on screen, after closing it, you will see adsorption color corresponding the UV-Vis spectrum
and its complementary color. At the same time, maximum brightness forms of these two colors are
also shown on screen. Commonly the color shown at bottom right corner of the window can be
regarded as the actually displayed color of the substance. Meantime, from command-line window
of Multiwfn, you can find detailed parameters of the colors shown on screen, such as CIE1931 XYZ
values, RGB values in sRGB color space, etc.
• Case 2: Predicting color for a given spectrum curve recorded in plain text file
In this case, you can predict color based on e.g. experimentally determined spectrum curve.
The input file should be a plain text file containing two column data, the first column is wavelength
in nm, the second column is absorbance in arbitrary unit (see examples\spectra\Allura_red_UVVis.txt for example. The data range and spacing are arbitrary, the two columns should be separated
by space or comma). After loading the input file, enter main function 11 and then choose option “0:
Predicting color based on UV-Vis spectrum recorded in text file”, you will see predicted colors, the
information provided by Multiwfn has the same form as that mentioned in case (1).
Two noteworthy points
The present function evidently can also be used to predict color of emission spectrum. For
example, there a system satisfying Kasha’s rule. To predict its fluorescence spectrum, you should
perform electron excitation calculation at its optimized S1 geometry, and use the output file as input
file of Multiwfn. After entering main function 11 and selection option 3 to enter the module for
plotting UV-Vis spectrum, you should first select option “20 Modify oscillator strengths” to set
oscillator strength of all excited states except for S1 to zero, and then use option 25 to predict color
of the present spectrum (corresponding to fluorescence spectrum). In this case you should take the
color shown under “color” label on the graphic window as the color of fluorescence emission, and
the complementary color shown on the window is useless in this case.
Flexible molecules often have multiple conformations with nonnegligible weight at the
temperature of interest, if some of them show distinctly different light adsorption character in visible
light range, to reliably predict color you must take conformation weighting average of spectrum into
