This chapter introduces all functions of Multiwfn in detail, the numbers in the parentheses of
secondary titles are indices of corresponding functions in main menu, the numbers in the parentheses
of tertiary titles are indices of corresponding options in corresponding submenus. Different
functions of Multiwfn require different types of input file, the information needed by each function
are shown in the final line of corresponding section. Please choose proper type of input file
according to the table in Section 2.5.
[There is no Section 3.1 due to history reason ;-D]

3.2 Showing molecular structure and viewing orbitals /
isosurfaces (0)
When main function 0 is selected, information of all atoms as well as basic information of
featured orbitals (e.g. index of HOMO and LUMO, HOMO-LUMO gap) will be printed on text
window, meanwhile molecular structure will be shown in a GUI window. If the input file contains
orbital information, the orbitals can be viewed by selecting corresponding orbital index in the list at
right-bottom corner of the window, or by directly inputting orbital index in the text box, see below
screenshot. If the input file is .cub or .grd format, then one can view isosurface of the grid data in
this interface.

Since most widgets in this GUI are self-explanatory, I only mention some worth noting points
here.
Changing viewpoint
• Mouse dragging operations: In the drawing region, one can use the left mouse button to drag
the system to freely rotate it. Holding down the Ctrl key and drag the system horizontally can rotate
it along the screen. Holding down the Ctrl key and drag the system vertically can scale the system.
Holding down the Shift key and drag the system can translate it. Notice for Linux users: only after
clicking the drawing region once to make the icon become a hand, the aforementioned dragging
operations will be available.
• Other operations: You can also rotate the viewpoint by clicking "Left", "Right", "Up",
"Down" buttons at the right side of GUI. Zoom in and out can also be realized by scrolling mouse
wheel in the drawing region.
To exactly set the view, one can also directly input rotation angles by selecting "Set rotation of
viewpoint" option in "Set view" dropdown list in the menu, in this list there are also many other
options to change view.
Changing drawing settings
"Ratio of atomic size" is the ratio of one-fourth of atom radius shown on screen to its van der
Waals (vdW) radius, so if the slide bar is dragged to 4.0, then what to be shown is vdW surface.
There are three predefined drawing styles of system structure, you can activate one of them via
“Use CPK style”, “Use vdW style” and “Use line style” in “Other settings” in the menu.
Multiwfn determines if two atoms are bonded by empirical distance criteria, if the distance
between two atoms is short than 1.15 times of the sum of their CSD covalent radii, they will be
considered as bonded. You can adjust this criterion by dragging "Bonding threshold" slide bar.
Note: If your input file contains connectivity information, such as .mol and .mol2, then the bonds will be
displayed directly according to the provided connectivity.

The color of bonds, atomic labels and atom spheres can be set by parameters "bondRGB",
"atmlabRGB" and "atmcolorfile" in settings.ini, respectively. See corresponding comments for
detail. After adjusting these parameters, you need to reboot Multiwfn to make them take effect. You
can also directly change atomic label color in the GUI via “Other settings”-“Set atomic label color”.
Viewing orbitals
By clicking "Orbital info." and then selecting corresponding options, basic orbital
information can be printed on text window.
All orbital indices are listed in the right-bottom box, default selection is “none” (no orbital is
shown). If you click an orbital index, Multiwfn will calculate grid data of wavefunction value for
corresponding orbital, and then the orbital isosurface appears immediately. Green and blue parts
correspond to positive and negative regions, respectively. The “Isovalue” slide bar controls the
isovalue of the isosurface.
For efficiency consideration, the default quality of grid data is relatively coarse, the number of
grid points can be set by "Isosur. quality", the larger number leads to the smoother isosurface (Note
that after you adjust the number, present isosurface will be deleted). You can also set default number
of grid points through changing “nprevorbgrid” in settings.ini.
For unrestricted wavefunction, the alpha and beta orbitals are recorded separately. Assume that
there are Na alpha orbitals and Nb beta orbitals, then the first Na and latter Nb orbitals in the orbital
selection list correspond to alpha and beta orbitals, respectively. Whereas in the orbital selection

box, negative index corresponds to beta orbitals. For example, if you input -9, then the 9th beta
orbital will be shown, and the orbital selection list will be automatically switched to the Na+9 term.
Sometimes it is useful to display two orbitals simultaneously; for example, analysis of phase
overlapping of two NBOs. This can be realized by "Show+Sel. Isosur#2" (Sel.=Select) check box.
This check box is inactive by default, once you have chosen an orbital (corresponding isosurface
will be referred to as Isosurface #1), this check box will be activated. After you clicked the check
box, the isosurface of the orbital you newly selected (which will be referred to as Isosurface #2) will
be shown together with the orbital you previously selected, yellow-green and purple parts
correspond to positive and negative regions respectively. If the check box is deselected, Isosurface
#2 will disappear, then if you reselect the check box the same Isosurface #2 will be redrawn.
The representation styles of Isosurface #1 and #2 can be adjusted by suboptions in "Isosur.
#1" and "Isosur. #2" individually, available styles include solid face (default), mesh, points, solid
face+mesh and transparent face. (Notice that Multiwfn cannot plot only one isosurface as
transparent face). The colors for face and mesh/points can be set by corresponding suboptions too,
users will be prompted to input Red, Green, Blue components for positive and negative parts in turn,
the component should between 0.0 and 1.0. For instance, 1.0,0.0,0.0 corresponds to pure red while
1.0,1.0,0.0 corresponds to Yellow. The default values for positive and negative parts can be set by
"isoRGB_same" and "isoRGB_oppo" in settings.ini, respectively. Opacity for transparent face can
also be customized, valid range is from 0.0 (completely transparent) to 1.0 (completely opaque).
Before showing orbital isosurfaces, Multiwfn first sets up a box internally, then calculates
orbital wavefunction value at the points evenly placed in the box. The default extension distance for
setting up the box is controlled by "Aug3D" parameter in settings.ini. The default value is suitable
and efficient for general cases; however, in rare cases (e.g. visualizing Rydberg orbitals) you may
need to manually enlarge the extension distance, you can either change the Aug3D to modify the
default setting, or select "Other settings"-"Set extension distance" and then input a value to modify
extension distance for present instance.
When orbital isosurface is portrayed as solid face, in rare cases the plotting effect is not quite
good, for example positive and negative regions are difficult to be distinguished, in these cases you
can try to adjust lighting setting by choosing "Other settings"-"Set lighting" or properly rotate the
system to bypass this issue.
If you want to visualize probability density of the selected orbital instead of its wavefunction,
you can choose “Other settings” - “Choose plotting wavefunction or density”, and then choose
“Density”.
“Tools” submenu
In the "Tools" of the menu bar, there are many options:
• Write settings to GUIsettings.ini: Write visualization state (e.g. color, view angle, molecular
representation, text size, etc.) to GUIsettings.ini in current folder. If "Multiwfnpath" environment
variable has been defined, the GUIsettings.ini will be written to the folder defined by this
environment variable instead.
• Load settings from GUIsettings.ini: Load visualization state from GUIsettings.ini in current
folder, so that you can quickly retrieve previous visualization state. If "Multiwfnpath" environment
variable has been defined, Multiwfn will first try to load this file from the folder defined by this
environment variable.
• Measure geometry: By inputting two, three and four atom indices in the boxes and press
