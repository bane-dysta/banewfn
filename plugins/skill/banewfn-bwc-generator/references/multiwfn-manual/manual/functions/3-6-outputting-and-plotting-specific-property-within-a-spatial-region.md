length of yielded interbasin paths equals to product of the two values. Note that if distance between
a point in interbasin path and the plotting plane exceeds the "disshowlabel" in settings.ini,
corresponding points in the interbasin path will not be shown on the plane graph.

3.6 Outputting and plotting specific property within a
spatial region (5)
The main purpose of this function is calculating grid data or generating Gaussian-type cube
file (.cub) for specific real space function. The .cub file is supported by a lot of chemistry
visualization softwares, such as VMD, GaussView, and VESTA. The isosurface of generated grid
data can be viewed directly in Multiwfn too. This function can also be used to calculate function
values for a set of points recorded in a plain text file.
The basic procedure of using this function is:
(1) Select a real space function
(2) Set up grid
(3) Use post-processing options to visualize isosurfaces, modify and export data
PS: In the real space function selection menu, if you select option 111 (a hidden option), then the real space
function to be calculated will be Becke weight of an atom or Becke overlap weight between two atoms. If you select
option 112 (another hidden option), Hirshfeld weight of a given atom or fragment will be calculated.

Setting up grid
Multiwfn provides many modes for setting up grid point:
Mode 1: Low quality grid, about 125000 points in total (corresponding to 50*50*50 grid,
assuming the spatial region is cubic), this mode is recommended for previewing purpose.
Mode 2: Medium quality grid, about 512000 points in total (corresponding to 80*80*80 grid,
assuming the spatial region is cubic). For small molecular, this quality is enough for most analysis.
Mode 3: High quality grid, about 1728000 points in total (corresponding to 120*120*120 grid,
assuming the spatial region is cubic).
For modes 1, 2 and 3, the actual number of points in each direction is automatically determined
by Multiwfn so that grid spacing in each direction are nearly equal. The method of determining
spatial scope of grid data is illustrated below in two-dimension case.

First, Multiwfn sets up a box (red dashed line) to just enclose the entire molecule, and then the
box is suitably extended in each dimension to avoid truncating boundary part of isosurfaces, the
green rectangle in below graph is the actual spatial scope of grid data. If the extension distance is
inappropriate, you can set the value by using option “-10 Set extension distance of grid range", or
directly set default value by modifying “Aug3D” in settings.ini.
The so-called “Low quality”, “Medium quality” and “High quality” respectively corresponding to modes 1, 2
and 3 are only relative to medium-sized systems, because each of them corresponds to a fixed number of grid points.
For a large system, spatial range of grid data is often wide, then grid density of mode 3 will not be very fine and
should actually be called “Medium quality” in this context, and mode 2 should be called “Low quality”. In contrast,
for a micro system, the density of grid points of mode 1 is already fine enough for most purposes.

Mode 4: Specify the number of grid points or grid spacing in X, Y and Z directions yourself,
the spatial scope is determined automatically as shown above.
Mode 5: Specify all details of grid setting by user, including original point, the number of
points and grid spacings in X, Y and Z directions. This mode is useful for experienced users.
Mode 6: Specify the center coordinate, number of points and extension distance in X, Y and Z
directions. For example, the center coordinate you inputted is 2.3,1.0,5.5, the extension distance in
X, Y and Z is k,k,m, then the coordinates of two most distant endpoints are (2.3-k,1.0-k,5.5-m) and
(2.3+k,1.0+k,5.5+m). This mode is useful for analyzing local properties.
Mode 7: Like function 6, but inputting indices of two atoms instead of inputting center
coordinate, the midpoint between the two nuclei will be set as center. This mode is very useful for
weak interaction analysis by RDG function. For examples, we want to study the weak interaction
region between the dimer shown below, and we found C1 and C14 may enclose this region, so we
input 1,14. see Section 3.23.1 for example. If the two atom indices are identical, then the nuclear
coordinate will be set as center.

Mode 8: Use grid setting (origin, number of points and grid spacing) of an existing cube file.
You will be prompted to input the file name. This mode is useful to generate multiple cube files with
exactly identical grid setting.
Mode 9: This mode is visible only when input file contains cell information (i.e.
modified .molden file of CP2K is used as input file, see Section 2.9.2.1, or other files carrying cell
information is used as input file, see Section 2.9.3). You will be requested to input coordinate of
origin, box lengths, and grid spacing (shared by all the three dimensions). If you press ENTER
button directly when Multiwfn asks you to set origin and box lengths, the relationship of the box
and the cell will correspond to the situation shown below, in which each point of intersection
corresponds to a grid point to be calculated. As you can see, in each direction, the length of the box
differs from the length of cell by a grid spacing. In this case, integral of a function can be
straightforwardly evaluated based on grid data as ∑𝑖 𝑓(𝑖)𝑣, where f(i) is function value at grid i and
v is grid volume. Note that the inputted grid spacing will be automatically adjusted to that the
number of grids is an integer.

Mode 10: Set up the grid data in a GUI window. This mode is quite convenient, the box is
clearly visible in the graphic window, and you can directly change box length, box center and grid
spacing by dragging corresponding scale bars (the X,Y,Z directions share the same grid spacing).
The total number of grids under present grid setting can be directly seen at the right bottom side of
the window.

Mode 11: You will be asked to input atomic indices to define a fragment and input extension
distance, then the box will be determined by extending the given distance around the fragment. You
will be also prompted to input grid spacing, which is shared by all the three directions. This mode
is particularly useful when you want to employ non-covalent interaction (NCI) and independent
gradient model (IGM) methods to visually study interaction between a molecule (the fragment you
defined) and surroundings.
Notice that the more grid points you set, the finer the isosurface graph you will get, however
the more time is needed for calculating grid data and generating isosurface graph. The increase of
calculation time with the number of points is nearly linear.
After setting grid points, the program starts to calculate grid data, once the calculation is
finished, the minimum/maximum and corresponding coordinate, the sum of all/positive/negative
data multiplied by differential element are printed on screen immediately. If what you calculated is
electron density, the molecular dipole moment evaluated based on grid data is also printed out. Then
you will see post-processing menu.
Post-processing options
In the post-processing menu if the option “-1 Show isosurface graph” is selected, a GUI
window will pop up, which shows the isosurface of grid data, all widgets are self-explanatory, you
can change isosurface value by both dragging slide bar (upper and lower limit are -5 and +5
respectively) or inputting precise value in text box (then press “Enter” button in your keyboard); if
“Show data range” is selected, the spatial scope will be marked by a blue frame as the one in above
picture (if spatial scope exceeds the range of coordinate axis, the frame will not be displayed). The
isosurfaces with the same and reverse sign of current isovalue are in green and blue respectively.
Option 1 can export isosurface graph to graphical file in current directory. Option 2 can export
