3 Functions
For elements in IV A group, Multiwfn uses sp3 configuration to replace s2p2 ground state by
default. This treatment is reasonable, since in most molecules these atoms are in sp3 hybridization.
For VI A, VII A and Fe, Co, Ni, Multiwfn equalizes the occupation number of orbitals within the
same shell; for example, oxygen has two singly occupied 2p orbitals and one doubly occupied 2p
orbitals in ground state, the number of electrons in this shell is 4, so Multiwfn sets the occupation
number of all the three orbitals to 4/3. This method works because the shape of occupied orbitals
are always nearly identical, regardless of the original occupation number is one or two. However,
the difference between virtual orbital and occupied orbital is remarkable, thus Multiwfn uses another
method to sphericalize electron density of elements in III A group, as well as Sc, Ti and V. In this
method, the singly occupied orbitals are duplicated and rotated. Taking boron as example, assume
that the singly occupied 2p orbital is directing along Z-axis, Multiwfn replicates this orbital twice
and turn them toward X-axis and Y-axis respectively, finally the occupation numbers of the three
orbitals are set to 1/3. (Users needn’t to check the orientation of singly occupied orbital by
themselves). If you hope that Multiwfn sphericalizes atoms in IV A group in such manner instead
of using sp3 configuration, set “SpherIVgroup” in settings.ini to 1.
Notice that the sphericalization methods used in Multiwfn are closely related to wavefunction
type, the methods fail if unrestricted wavefunction is used for main group elements or restricted
open-shell wavefunction is used for transition metals. These methods also fail if Hartree-Fock
method is used for transition metals, because orbital order produced by HF is different from most
DFT cases (the HF’s order is wrong, 4s is higher than 3d).

3.8 Checking & modifying wavefunction (6)
This function provides a lot of subfunctions for checking and modifying loaded wavefunction,
all subfunctions take effect immediately, so after modification(s) you can print related information
via proper subfunction to check if your previous operations are correct. After returning to main menu,
all subsequent analyses which make use of wavefunction information will be affected. The title in
this interface shows the number of GTFs, orbitals, atoms and alpha/beta/total electrons of present
wavefunction.
Once you finished all modifications of wavefunction, you can save current wavefunction to
new.wfn in current folder via subfunction 0. If you want to save to other wavefunction format, you
should return to main menu first, and then enter subfunction 2 of main function 100, then choose
corresponding option to save to an expected format.
Below I briefly introduce each subfunction in this main function.
Subfunction -3 and -4: Defining molecular fragment. In -3 you directly define fragment by
inputting atomic indices; while in -4 you should input the indices of the atoms to be excluded, the
remaining atoms will constitute the fragment. The GTFs whose centers do not belong to this
fragment will be discarded (can be imagined as corresponding GTF coefficients in all orbitals are
set to zero). This function affects all the following analyses which make use of GTF information, in
particular, the calculations involving real space functions.
When use these two subfunctions? For large molecules, what you are interested in may be only
a small region, by discarding atoms in other regions, the calculation speed of time-consuming task

such as generating grid data can be increased evidently. Besides, sometimes you only want to obtain
real space function contributed by certain atoms, these two functions can fulfill your purpose.
This function can be safely used together with main function 1~6. For other tasks, DO NOT
use this function if you do not understand what you are exactly doing, otherwise you may obtain
wrong or meaningless results. Notice that this function is irreversible, the discarded GTFs cannot
be recovered, unless you reboot the program and reload the wavefunction file.
Subfunction 0: Save current wavefunction to new.wfn file in current directory. Notice that the
orbitals with zero occupation number and the atoms do not have GTFs will be automatically
discarded during saving.
Subfunction 1: Print information of all GTFs, including the centers they are belonging to, GTF
types and exponents.
Subfunction 2: Print information of all basis functions, including the shells/centers they
attributed to, types, and corresponding GTF index ranges.
Subfunction 3: Print basic information of all orbitals, including energies, occupation numbers,
orbital types (Alpha, beta or alpha+beta).
Subfunction 4: Print detail information of an orbital, including the expansion coefficients with
respect to GTFs (along with GTF information), note that the coefficients include GTF normalization
constants.
Subfunction 5: Print coefficient matrix in basis functions (not the coefficients with respect to
GTFs), only available when the input file contains basis function information.
Subfunction 6: Print one-particle density matrix in basis functions, only available when the
input file contains basis function information.
Subfunction 7: Print various kinds of integral matrix between basis functions, including
overlap integrals, electric/magnetic dipole moment integrals, kinetic energy integrals, velocity
integrals, electric quadrupole and octopole integrals. For overlap matrix, eigenvalues are printed
together, which are useful for checking linear dependency. Only available when the input file
contains basis function information.
Subfunction 11: Exchange centers or types or exponents or orbital expansion coefficients of
two GTFs, or exchange all information of two GTFs at once (equivalent to exchanging recording
order of two GTFs, thus does not affect any analysis result)
Subfunction 21 to 24: Set center, type, exponent and expansion coefficient of a specific GTF
in an orbital, respectively.
Subfunction 25: Set expansion coefficients of some GTFs in some orbitals to a specific value.
The GTFs simultaneously satisfying the three inputted conditions will be selected: Index range of
GTFs, index range of the atoms that GTFs centered at, GTF types (input specific type, such as YZ,
XXZ, etc., or input angular moment, such as S, P, D, etc.).
If the input file also contains basis function information, by this option you can also set
expansion coefficients of basis functions.
Subfunction 26: Set occupation number of some orbitals. You can directly set them to a
specific value, or add, minus, multiply, divide them by a given value. This function is very useful
for shielding the contributions from certain orbitals to real space functions, namely setting their
occupation numbers to zero before calculating real space functions.
Subfunction 27: Set orbital type of some orbitals, then wavefunction type will be
automatically updated, please check the prompts shown on the screen.

Subfunction 28: Set energy of some orbitals. You can directly set them to a specific value, or
add, minus, multiply, divide them by a given value. This function is useful when you want to rectify
the orbital energies using a given relationship (e.g. J. Am. Chem. Soc., 121, 3414 (1999)) before
plotting density-of-states (DOS) map.
Subfunction 29: Input indices of two orbitals, then all of their information (energy, occupation,
coefficients) will be exchanged
Subfunction 30: Exchange energies and occupation numbers for all orbitals. This is
particularly useful in obtaining EDDB grid data based on EDDB code of D. W. Szczepanik. After
loading the .fchk file exported by EDDB code, entering this function, and selecting option 1
(exchange orbital energies in eV with occupation numbers), then occupation numbers will
correspond to eigenvalues of Natural Orbital for Bond Delocalization (NOBD). Then if you use
main function 5 to calculate grid data of electron density as usual, the resulting grid data will directly
correspond to EDDB.
Subfunction 31: Translate the whole wavefunction and all atom coordinates of current system
by inputting translation vectors and their units.
Subfunction 32: Translate and duplicate the whole wavefunction and all atom coordinates of
current system, users need to input translation vectors, their units and how many times the system
will be translated and duplicated according to the translation vectors. This function is useful for
extending the primitive cell wavefunction outputted by Gaussian PBC function to supercell
wavefunction, of course you can calculate supercell wavefunction directly by Gaussian, but much
more computational time will be consumed. Notice that constructing wavefunction of supercell by
this way is only an approximation, because the mix between orbitals of neighbouring primitive cell
to new supercell orbitals is completely ignored.
Subfunction 33: Rotate wavefunction, namely X→Y, Y→Z, Z→X
Subfunction 34: Set occupation number of all inner molecular orbitals in present system to
zero, namely only contribution from valence orbitals will be reserved for subsequent studies. The
number of inner MOs is automatically determined, however, the atoms using pseudopotential are
not taken into account.
Subfunction 35: This function is very useful if you want to discard contribution of orbitals
with certain irreducible representation (IRREP) in all kinds of analyses. After you enter this
subfunction, IRREP of all occupied orbitals will be shown, the "N_orb" denotes the number of
occupied orbitals belonging to the corresponding IRREP. If you want to discard contribution of
some IRREPs in the succeeding analyses, you can select option 1 and input the index of the IRREPs,
then the occupation number of corresponding orbitals will be set to zero and thus their contributions
are eliminated, and you will also see their status are changed from "Normal" to "discarded". Then
you can choose option 0 to save wavefunction and quit. You can also choose option 2 to recover the
original occupation number of all orbitals, or choose 3 to reverse the status of every IRREP between
"Normal" and "Discarded". Note that this subfunction only works for .mwfn, .molden and .gms files,
because only these files record orbital IRREPs (beware that the IRREPs in the .molden file produced
by many quantum chemistry programs are missing or incorrect). Besides, only restricted and
unrestricted SCF wavefunctions are supported.
Subfunction 36: Invert phase of some orbitals (i.e. replacing expansion coefficients of basis
functions and GTFs of these orbitals with their negative values).
Subfunction 37: This option converts restricted (R) or restricted open-shell (RO)
