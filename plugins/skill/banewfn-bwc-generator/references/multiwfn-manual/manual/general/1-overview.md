1 Overview
Multiwfn is a powerful wavefunction analysis program, it supports almost all of the most
important wavefunction analysis methods. Multiwfn is free, open-source, high-efficient, very userfriendly and flexible. Multiwfn can be downloaded at Multiwfn official website
http://sobereva.com/multiwfn. This code is developed by Tian Lu at Beijing Kein Research Center
for Natural Sciences (http://www.keinsci.com).

Input files supported by Multiwfn
Multiwfn accepts many kinds of files for loading wavefunction information: .mwfn (Multiwfn
wavefunction file), .wfn/.wfx (Conventional / Extended PROAIM wavefunction file), .fch
(Gaussian formatted check file), .molden (Molden input file), .31~.40 (NBO plot files) and .gms
(GAMESS-US and Firefly output file). Other types such as Gaussian input and output
files, .cub, .grd, .pdb, .xyz and .mol files can be used for specific functions.
Briefly speaking, Multiwfn can perform wavefunction analyses based on outputted file of
almost all well-known quantum chemistry programs, such as Gaussian, ORCA, GAMESS-US,
Molpro, NWChem, Dalton, xtb, PSI4, Molcas, Q-Chem, MRCC, deMon2k, Firefly, CFOUR,
Turbomole... Since .molden file exported by CP2K is also supported, Multiwfn is not only able to
deal with molecular systems but can also analyze periodic systems (though limited functions can be
used, see Section 2.9 of manual for detail).

Special points of Multiwfn
(1) Very comprehensive functions. Almost all of the most important wavefunction analysis
methods have been well supported by Multiwfn.
(2) Extremely user-friendly. Multiwfn is designed as an interactive program (but can also run
silently and be embedded into shell script), prompts shown on screen in each step clearly tell users
what should input next. Multiwfn also never prints obscure messages, therefore there is no any
barrier even for beginners. In addition, all wavefunction analysis theories are very detailedly
documented, and there are more than one hundred of well-written examples in the manual;
furthermore, there is a "quick start" document that guides new users to master common analyses
immediately. Moreover, the developer always very timely and patiently replies all users' questions
in Multiwfn official forum.
(3) High flexibility. The design of the overall framework, functions and user interface of
Multiwfn is rather flexible, but this does not sacrifice ease of use. Different modules of Multiwfn
are organically integrated together to make numerous analyses that single module cannot realize
feasible
(4) High efficiency. The code of Multiwfn is substantially optimized. Most parts are
parallelized by OpenMP technology. For computationally intensive tasks, the efficiency of Multiwfn
exceeds analogous programs significantly.
(5) Results can be visualized directly. A high-level graphical library DISLIN is invoked
internally and automatically by Multiwfn for visualizing results, most plotting parameters are
controllable in interactive interface. This remarkably simplified wavefunction analysis, especially

for studying distribution of real space functions.

Major functions of Multiwfn
PS: Despite that there are so many functions in Multiwfn and the manual is quite thick, you
can easily learn how to realize the functions listed below by checking the "Multiwfn quick start"
document in Multiwfn binary package.

Showing molecular structure and viewing orbitals (MO, NBO, natural orbital, NTO, LMO,
etc.). Speed of generating orbital graph is extremely fast, and the use is very convenient.

Outputting all supported real space functions as well as gradient and Hessian at a point.
Value can be decomposed to orbital contributions.

Calculating real space function along a line and plot curve map.

Calculating real space function in a plane and plot plane map. Supported graph types
include filled-color map, contour map, relief map (with/without projection), gradient map
and vector field map.

Calculating real space function in a spatial scope, data can be exported to Gaussian-type
cube grid file (.cub) and can be visualized as isosurface.

For the calculation of real space functions in one-, two- and three-dimensions, user can
define the operations between the data generated from multiple wavefunction files.
Therefore one can calculate and plot such as Fukui function, dual descriptor and density
difference very easily. Meanwhile promolecule and deformation properties for all real
space functions can be calculated directly.

Topology analysis for any real space function, such as electron density (AIM analysis),
Laplacian, ELF, LOL, electrostatic potential and so on. Critical points (CPs) can be
located, topology paths and interbasin surfaces can be generated, and then they can be
directly visualized in a 3D GUI window or be plotted in plane map. Value of various real
space functions can be calculated at critical points or along topology paths. CP properties
can be decomposed as orbital contributions.

Checking and modifying wavefunction. For example, print orbital and basis function
information, manually set orbital occupation number and type, translate and duplicate
system, discard wavefunction information from specified atoms.

Population analysis. ADCH (Atomic dipole moment corrected Hirshfeld), Hirshfeld,
Hirshfeld-I, MBIS, VDD, Mulliken, Löwdin, Modified Mulliken (including three
methods: SCPA, Stout & Politzer, Bickelhaupt), Becke, CM5, 1.2*CM5, CHELPG, MerzKollmann, RESP, RESP2, AIM (Atoms-in-Molecules) and EEM (Electronegativity
Equalization Method) are supported. Electrostatic interaction energy of two given
fragments can be calculated based on atomic charges.

Orbital composition analysis. Mulliken, Stout & Politzer, SCPA, Hirshfeld, Hirshfeld-I,
Becke, natural atomic orbital (NAO) and AIM methods are supported to obtain orbital
composition. Orbital delocalization index (ODI) or spatial delocalization index (SDI) can
be calculated to quantify extent of spatial delocalization of orbitals.

multi-center index (MCI) in AO or natural atomic orbital (NAO) basis (arbitrary number
of centers); Wiberg bond order in Löwdin orthogonalized basis; Mulliken bond order;

be decomposed to orbital contributions. Wiberg bond order can be decomposed to
contribution from various NAO pair interactions.
Plotting total, partial, overlap population density-of-states (TDOS, PDOS, OPDOS) and
MO-PDOS. Up to 10 fragments can be very flexibly and conveniently defined. Local
DOS (LDOS) can also be plotted for a point as curve map or for a line as color-filled map.
Furthermore, plotting photoelectron spectrum (PES) based on (generalized) Koopmans'
theorem is fully supported, d-band and p-band centers can be calculated. Crystal overlap
Hamilton populations (COHP) can also be plotted.
Plotting various kinds of spectra: IR (infrared), regular/pre-resonance Raman, UV-Vis,
directional UV-Vis, ECD (electronic circular dichroism), VCD (vibrational circular
dichroism), Raman optical activity (ROA) and NMR. For vibrational spectra, not only
harmonic spectrum, but also anharmonic fundamental, overtone and combination bands
can be plotted. Spin-orbit coupling effect could be incorporated for electronic spectra.
Abundant parameters (broadening function, FWHM, scale factor, etc.) can be customized
by users. Maxima and minima of the spectra can be printed and directly labelled on the
map. Spikes can be added to bottom of the graph to clearly indicate position and
degeneracy of transition levels. Total spectrum can be decomposed to individual
contribution of each transition. Spectrum of multiple systems can be conveniently plotted
together. Conformational weighted spectrum can be easily plotted. In addition, for
vibrational type of spectra, partial vibrational spectrum (PVS) can be plotted to intuitively
understand how different atoms or internal coordinates participate in the spectra, and
overlap partial vibration spectrum (OPVS) can be plotted to visualize coupling of various
terms. Partial vibrational density-of-states (PVDOS) can also be plotted. Color displayed
by a chemical substance can be exactly predicted based on its theoretically simulated and
experimentally determined UV-Vis spectrum.
Quantitative analysis of molecular surface. Surface properties such as
(total/positive/negative/polar/nonpolar) surface area, enclosed volume, average value and
std. of mapped functions can be computed for overall molecular surface or local surfaces;
Various kinds of GIPF descriptors and molecular polarity index (MPI) can be evaluated;
minima and maxima of mapped functions on the surface can be located; area of
characteristic region corresponding to e.g. /-hole and lone pair can be calculated based

perform mathematical operations on grid data, set value in certain range, extract data in
specified plane, plot (local) integral and plane-averaged curve, etc.

the AdNDP orbitals can be visualized directly. Energy and orbital composition of AdNDP
orbitals can be obtained.

partition methods are supported, the following quantities can be computed: Integral of
real space functions in atomic spaces or in overlap region between atomic spaces, dipole
and multipole moments of atom/fragment/molecule, atomic multipole moments, atomic
