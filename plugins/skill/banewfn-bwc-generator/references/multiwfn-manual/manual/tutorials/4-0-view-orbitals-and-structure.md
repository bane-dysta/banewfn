4.0 View orbitals and structure
In this section, I will first introduce how to use the built-in interface for visualizing various
kinds of orbitals, then in Section 4.0.3, I will show how to use Multiwfn in combination with VMD
to easily and quickly plot state-of-art orbital graphs.

4.0.1 Viewing molecular orbitals of cycloheptatriene
Boot up Multiwfn, input examples\cycloheptatriene.fch and press ENTER button, then select
main function 0, a GUI window will pop up, meanwhile information of all atom coordinates along
with basic information of featured molecular orbitals are printed on Multiwfn console window.

You can zoom in/out the system by scrolling mouse wheel, and rotate the system by clicking
Up/Down/Left/Right buttons on the right side of the GUI. You can also freely rotate the system by
dragging it in the drawing region via left mouse button; you can also hold the Ctrl key and drag the
system with left mouse button horizontally and vertically to rotate it along the screen and zoom
in/out, respectively; moreover, you can hold down the Shift key and drag the system to translate it.
Note that if you are using Linux version, the aforementioned mouse dragging operations will be
available only after clicking the drawing region once to make the icon become a hand.
You can also adjust bonding threshold, adjust size of atom spheres and labels, save the graph
as image file, and so on, via corresponding widgets on the right side of the GUI. See Section 3.2 for

more information.
The numbers in the right-bottom list are orbital indices, you can view orbital isosurface by
selecting corresponding index, or directly inputting the orbital index in the text box and then press
ENTER button. Note that if your system is unrestricted open-shell, to select beta orbital you should
input negative index, for example, -5 corresponds to the 5th beta orbital. Plot two orbitals
simultaneously in this window is also possible, as illustrated in Section 4.0.2.
For convenience, if your input file records R/U/RO(HF/KS) wavefunction, you can directly
input orbital label in the text box at right-bottom corner. For example, inputting h stands for choosing
HOMO, l+2 corresponds to LUMO+2, la corresponds to LUMO of alpha, hb-3 corresponds to
HOMO-3 of beta, etc.
The green and blue isosurfaces correspond to positive and negative parts, respectively. The
isovalue can be adjusted by dragging slide bar, you can also input its value via “Set isovalue” option
in “Other settings” drop-down list at the top of the GUI. Isosurface style and colors and be altered
by corresponding suboptions in "Isosur#1 style". The quality of the isosurface can be set by the
options in "Isosur. quality".
By selecting "Orbital info."-"Show all", energy, occupation number and type of all orbitals will
be shown in Multiwfn console window. If you do not want too many high-lying virtual MOs are
shown, you can choose "Show up to LUMO+10" or "Show occupied orbitals". If irreducible
representations are recorded in the loaded .mwfn/molden/gms file, then they will be shown as the
last column.
In the "Other settings" and "Tools" of the menu bar, there are many useful options, please play
with them, and when you are confused, see Section 3.2 for explanation. The "Tools” - “Batch
plotting orbitals" is quite worth noting, via this tool you can very conveniently save a lot of selected
orbitals to respective image file in current folder, see https://youtu.be/SHwrQhqBHZ0 for video
illustration.
If you want to plot probability density of an orbital instead of its wavefunction, you can choose
“Other settings” - “Choose plotting wavefunction or density”, and then choose “Density”.
To close the window, click “RETURN” button. More detailed explanation about this interface
can be found in See Section 3.2.
Note: Visualizing isosurface of Rydberg orbitals by main function 0 of Multiwfn is also possible, however,
since they show very diffuse character, in order to avoid truncating of isosurfaces, you should select "Other settings""Set extension distance" in the menu, and then input a relatively large value, for example, 12 (the unit is Bohr), then
select the orbital to visualize it. The default value of extension distance is controlled by "Aug3D" in settings.ini. An
example of visualizing Rydberg orbitals is given in Part 2 of Section 4.200.5.

Tip: Recommendation of the steps for obtaining pretty orbital isosurface graph
• Enter main function 0, select the orbital to be visualized, properly set isovalue
• Click "Show Labels" to disable axis
• Properly adjust viewpoint
• Properly change the size of atomic labels. Note that type of the labels can be changed via
"Set atomic label type" in "Other settings" at menu bar
• If the rendering effect of the isosurface is not quite good, use "Set lighting" in "Other settings"
to adjust lightings.
• Select "Isosur. quality" in the menu bar, set to "high quality" (medium sized system) or "very
high quality" (large system).
• Click "Save picture". Use such as Irfanview or Photoshop program to open it, shrink the size
of the image file to 50% (in this process resample will be automatically done, making anti-aliasing

effect effectively realized), then properly crop the graph.
Below is an example obtained via above steps, the quality is pretty good

It is suggested to use "face+mesh" drawing style instead of the default "solid face", since in
this case the saved picture will be more stereoscopic.

4.0.2 Viewing natural bond orbitals (NBO) of ethanol
There are two ways to view NBOs, if you are a Gaussian user, way 2 may be more convenient,
however if you also need to view natural hybrid orbital (NHO) or natural atomic orbital (NAO) or
some other types of orbitals generated by NBO program, you have to use way 1.
Way 1: Using NBO plot files
The common way is to generate NBO plot files (.31~.40) and load them into Multiwfn. To
generate these files by Gaussian, you should add pop=nboread in route section, that means the
keywords of NBO at the end of input file will be passed to NBO module (Link 607 in Gaussian),
then add for example $NBO plot file=C:\NH2COH $END at the end of the input file with a blank
line before it, you can refer to the NH2COH_NBO.gjf in “example” directory. Run the input file by
Gaussian, you will find that NH2COH.31, NH2COH.32 ... NH2COH.41 have been generated in C:\
folder. The NH2COH.31 and NH2COH.37 have already been provided in “example” folder. Now
boot up Multiwfn and input following commands
examples\NH2COH.31 // .31 file contains necessary basis function information for plotting
examples\NH2COH.37 // .37 file contains NBO information. .32~.40 files correspond to
PNAO/NAO/PNHO/NHO/PNBO/NBO/PNLMO/NLMO/MO respectively. Hint: You can only
input 37, because in present example the .37 and the .31 file share the same name
0 // Enter the GUI
You can choose corresponding NBO orbital from right-bottom list to view the isosurface.
Multiwfn is also capable to plot two orbitals simultaneously, for instance, here we will plot NBO 12
and NBO 56, which correspond to occupied lone pair of nitrogen atom and unoccupied anti-π bond
between carbon and oxygen atoms respectively. Firstly, we choose 12 from the orbital list to plot
NBO 12, and then click "Show+Sel. isosur#2", after that we click 56 in the list, you will see both of
NBO 12 and NBO 56 are shown. The yellow-green and purple parts of NBO 56 (isosurface#2)
correspond to positive and negative parts, respectively.

It is somewhat difficult to study overlapping extent between the two orbitals from the solid
face graph, so we choose "Use mesh" in "Isosur#1 style" and the counterpart in "Isosur#2 style" to
make the two isosurfaces represented as mesh, see below. (Please also try "transparent face" style)
Now the overlapping extent become distinct, it is quite clear that NBO 12 substantially overlapped
with NBO 56, the resulting strong delocalization is one of the main reasons why the second-order
perturbation energy between them is very large (~60 kcal/mol). In Section 4.4.5, you will learn how
to obtain contour map for the two orbitals.

Notice that for unrestricted calculations, .32 and .33 files outputted by NBO 3.1 module in Gaussian are
incorrect -- the title parts are missing, which will lead to strange result, you should fix them by consulting other plot
files such as .34, it is very easy.

Regarding the ways to pass the keywords for generating NBO plot files to NBO module in
other quantum chemistry packages, please consult corresponding manual. You can also use standalone version of NBO program (GENNBO) to generate NBO plot files, an input file (.47) is needed
to be prepared first. To generate it, you should load a file containing basis function information into
Multiwfn, then enter main function 100, select subfunction 2, then choose corresponding option to
export .47 file. After that, manually add plot keyword between “$NBO” and “$END” in the .47 file.
Then if you use GENNBO program to run the .47 file, you will get NBO plot files.
Way 2: Using .fch file as NBO information carrier
Gaussian provides a keyword pop=saveNBO, if you add it in your Gaussian input file, NBOs
will be saved to checkpoint file instead of MOs. You can use corresponding .fch file as Multiwfn

434

input file to view NBOs. If theoretical level of the task is HF or DFT, you should add saveNBOene
in the first line of the .fch file; if post-HF method is used and density keyword has also been specified,
you should add saveNBOocc in the first line of the .fch file, in this case Multiwfn will do some
special treatments internally. However, if your aim is just viewing NBOs in main function 0, you
can ignore this step.
Beware that when Gaussian storing the NBOs to checkpoint file, they may be automatically
reordered. For example, you may see the information like below in the Gaussian output file:
Reordering of NBOs for storage:

1

2

38 ...

That means the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th ... orbitals in the .chk/.fch file in fact correspond to the 7th, 8th,
3rd, 1st ... NBOs generated by the NBO module, respectively.
It is worth to note that if you use Multiwfn in combination with VMD, you can plot very pretty
NBO isosurface maps, see my blog article "Using Multiwfn to plot NBO and related orbitals" (in
Chinese, http://sobereva.com/134) for detail. Below is a map plotted by a Multiwfn user in his work
J. Mol. Graph. Model., 59, 31 (2015).

4.0.3 Using Multiwfn + VMD to rapidly plot high-quality orbital
isosurface map
Note: Chinese version of this tutorial is my blog articles “Using Multiwfn+VMD to rapidly plot high quality
isosurface map of molecular orbitals” (http://sobereva.com/447) and “Method of drawing state-of-the-art orbital
isosurface map using VMD” (http://sobereva.com/449).
Video illustration corresponding to this section is available at https://youtu.be/-3TXfdO8H7s, please never
forget to look at it!!!

Prologue
If one employs Multiwfn to export cube file for the orbitals of interest, and then render them
as isosurface map in VMD (http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/), very ideal orbital isosurface
map can be obtained, the procedure has been detailedly described in my blog article "Using
Multiwfn to visualize molecular orbitals" (in Chinese, http://sobereva.com/269). However, the
procedure introduced in this article is somewhat lengthy, many manual operations are needed. In
order to simplify the procedure as much as possible, here I show how to use scripts to very easily
and quickly draw high-quality orbital isosurface map by using Multiwfn and VMD in combination.
In this section I only illustrate how to plot MOs, but the same procedure can also be applied for
plotting other kinds of orbitals, however you need to properly modify the input stream file (see
below). If you do not know how to run Multiwfn in silent mode, I suggest you read Section 5.2 first
so that you can better understand this section. Here I assume you are using Windows system, for
Linux platform you should manually write corresponding script. The VMD program I used here is
version 1.9.3.

Preparation work
Copying showorb.bat and showorb.txt from "examples\scripts" to the folder containing
Multiwfn executable file.
The showorb.bat is a Windows batch process file, it is used to invoke Multiwfn to calculate
grid data of wavefunction for selected orbitals and then move the exported cube files to VMD folder.
You should manually edit this file to make the input file path corresponds to the actual path of input
file, and then replace the VMD folder in this file with actual VMD folder in your machine.
The showorb.txt is input stream file, each line corresponds a command needed to be inputted
in the Multiwfn interactive interface. You should manually set the third line as indices of the orbitals
you want to plot, for example, 10,20-23,28-30.
The showorb.vmd in "examples\scripts" is a VMD plotting script, you should copy it to VMD
folder, and then add source showorb.vmd to the end of the vmd.rc file in VMD folder, so that the
script will be automatically executed when VMD boots up. This script defines three customized
commands:
·orb i: Used to load cube file of orbital i and show it as isosurfaces. The default isovalue is
0.05, you can change it by editing showorb.vmd
·orbiso x: Used to change the isovalue to x.
·orbclean: Used to delete all orbital cube files in VMD folder.
Example
Here we plot MOs for examples\excit\D-pi-A.fchk. Make sure that all preparation works have
done, then edit the showorb.bat, replace the default input file 1.fch with examples\excit\D-pi-A.fchk,
and ensure that the actual VMD folder has been properly specified in this file. Then open
showorb.txt, set the third line as 54-59, so that we can visualize MOs from 54 to 59. Then doubleclick the showorb.bat, Multiwfn will be invoked to load input file, calculate and export grid data of
wavefunction for the selected orbital. For e.g. orbital 54, the exported file will be named
orb000054.cub. All the orbital cube files are then automatically moved to the VMD folder. After
that, boot up VMD, input orb 56 in VMD console window, then orb000056.cub will be loaded into
VMD and drawn as isosurfaces:

In above map, positive and negative phases are represented as red and blue colors, respectively.
"Glossy" material is used by default. If you want to change the color or material, you should enter
"Graphics" - "Representation" and modify corresponding options. You can also change default color
and material by modifying the showorb.vmd script.
If then you want to visualize another orbital, for example MO54, then simply input orb 54 in
the VMD console window.
If you want to change the isovalue to e.g. 0.02, simply input orbiso 0.02.

If after visualization, you want to clean all orbital cube files in the VMD folder, just input
orbclean, then all orb??????.cub files will be deleted.
By default, "medium quality grid" (about 512000 points) is used to calculate orbital
wavefunction, this is adequate for small and medium sized systems. However, for large systems,
such as those consisted of one hundred of atoms or more, you must employ higher number of grid
points. If you want to change the default grid to "high quality grid", you should set the fourth line
in showorb.txt to 3. In addition, as mentioned in Section 4.0.1, for visualizing Rydberg orbitals you
must increase extension distance of grid data. To do so, you should add
-10
12

between the third and fourth lines of showorb.txt, then extension distance will be increased from
default value to 12 Bohr.
Plot state-of-the-art orbital isosurface map
If you want to obtain even better quality of orbital isosurface graph, just follow below
procedure (please use VMD 1.9.3, DO NOT use other VMD version!):
(1) Plot an orbital in VMD as described above
(2) Copy all content in examples\scripts\VMDrender.txt to VMD console window to modify
the plotting setting
(3) In VMD, select "File" - "Render" - "Tachyon", click "Start Rendering". Then vmdscene.dat
will appear in VMD folder, it is input file of the Tachyon render.
(4) Copy the examples\scripts\VMDrender_full.bat to VMD folder
(5) Double click the VMDrender_full.bat, then the Tachyon render (tachyon_WIN32.exe) in
VMD folder will be invoked to carry out render. After a while, full.bmp appears in the VMD folder,
it is the produced image file.
The rendered image of MO56 of examples\excit\D-pi-A.fchk is shown below, the graph looks
extremely good!

The rendering time is fairly long for large systems. For saving time, you can use the
VMDrender_noshadow.bat instead of the VMDrender_full.bat, in this case no shadow effect will be
observed in the resulting graph, while the rendering cost is correspondingly reduced.
Sometimes, especially for large system, the shadows casted by the transparent orbital
isosurfaces make the graph look too dark, you can manually add -shadow_filter_off argument in
the .bat file to disable this kind of shadow during rendering.
