In the line of "Corr. hole (correlation hole)" and "Source function", the so-called "ref" is the
position of reference point, which is determined by "refxyz" parameter in settings.ini.
By default, the outputted wavefunction value corresponds to orbital 1, you can input for
example o6 to choose orbital 6.

By default, the components of gradient and Laplacian as well as Hessian and its
eigenvalue/eigenvectors are for electron density. You can input such as f10 to choose the real space
function with index of 10 (namely ELF), after that all of these quantities will be for ELF. If you
want to inquire indices of all available real space functions, input allf.
You can continue to input other coordinates, when you want to return to upper level menu,
input q; If you want to exit the program, press “CTRL+C” button or directly close command-line
window.

4.1.2 Calculate ESP at nuclear positions to evaluate interaction strength
of H2O∙∙∙HF
This is an advanced example, if you are not interested in weak interactions you may skip this section.

In J. Phys. Chem. A, 118, 1697 (2014), Mohan and Suresh studied a batch of electrostatic
dominated interacting systems, including hydrogen, halogen and dihydrogen bonds, all of them
belong to electron donor-acceptor interactions, where donor stands for electron-rich moiety (Lewis
base), while acceptor is electron-deficient moiety (Lewis acid). They fitted a surprisingly good
linear equation to correlate Vn index with interaction energy (Enb) for all kinds of interactions,
the R2 is as high as 0.9762. Their results can be summarized as following graph

For an electrostatic dominated complex, assume that we can obtain Vn, then according to
the equation shown in above graph, we can easily predict the interaction energies as

Enb = −89.2857  Vn − 0.125
The Vn is defined based on ESP at nuclear positions

Vn = Vn −D − Vn −A = (Vn −D' − Vn −D ) − (Vn −A' − Vn −A )
where Vn-D' is the ESP at nuclear position of donor atom in complex environment, but the
contribution due to nucleus of this donor atom is ignored. The only difference between Vn-D and VnD' is that the former is calculated in monomer state, therefore Vn-D = Vn-D' - Vn-D can be regarded as

the change in ESP at nuclear position of donor atom due to presence of another molecule, which
directly reflects strength of intermolecular interaction. The definition of Vn-A' and Vn-A are identical
to Vn-D' and Vn-D, respectively, but they are calculated for acceptor atom.
In this example, we calculate Vn for H2O∙∙∙HF and check if the interaction energy predicted
based on Vn is really closed to the accurately calculated interaction energy. In this complex the
oxygen of H2O is electron donor atom and hydrogen of HF is electron acceptor atom. Because the
equation presented by Mohan and Suresh was fitted for specific calculation level, in order to
properly use their equation, the calculation level we employed here is identical to them. The .wfn
files used below were produced at MP4(SDQ)/aug-cc-pVTZ level at MP2/6-311++G** optimized
geometries, these .wfn files and the corresponding Gaussian input files can be found in
"examples\Vn" folder.
Note that if you are using relatively old revision of G09 and post-HF method is employed, "density" keyword
is indispensable, otherwise the density in the resultant .wfn file will correspond to Hartree-Fock density. Besides, in
G09 and G16, density cannot be produced at MP4 level, so we use MP4(SDQ) keyword instead (MP4 keyword is
default to MP4(SDTQ), which is more accurate and but much expensive than MP4(SDQ)).

First we calculate Vn-A' and Vn-D'. Boot up Multiwfn and input
examples\Vn\H2O-HF.wfn
1 // Calculate properties at a point
a1 // Nuclear position of atom 1
From the output you can see
Total ESP without contribution from nuclear charge of atom

1:

-0.2228775074E+02 a.u. ( -0.6064805E+03 eV, -0.1398579E+05 kcal/mol)

That means Vn-D' is -22.2877 a.u. Then input a5, you will find Vn-A' is -0.9608 a.u.
Next we calculate Vn-D. Reboot up Multiwfn and input below commands
?H2O.wfn // The symbol ? means the folder of the file we last time loaded
1
a1 // In H2O.wfn oxygen is atom 1
We find Vn-D is -22.3339 a.u. Then we calculate Vn-A. Reboot Multiwfn and input
?HF.wfn
1
a2 // In HF.wfn hydrogen is atom 2
The Vn-A is found to be -0.9136 a.u.
The Vn is thus -22.2877-(-22.3339) - [-0.9608-(-0.9136)] = 0.0462 + 0.0472 = 0.0933 a.u.
Using the equation mentioned earlier, the interaction energy can be approximately predicted as
-89.28570.0933-0.125 = -8.45 kcal/mol, this value is quite close to the accurate interaction energies
(-8.31 kcal/mol) obtained by Mohan and Suresh at MP4/aug-cc-pVTZ level with Counterpoise
correction.
Generating wavefunction at MP4(SDQ)/aug-cc-pVTZ is quite time consuming even for small complex such as
the system we studied here, thus it is important to find a calculation level that significantly saves computational time
but without too much sacrifice in accuracy. For present system, based on the MP2/6-311++G** geometry, I tried
using several levels to evaluate the Vn:
B3LYP/6-311+G**: 0.1021 a.u.
MP2/cc-pVTZ: 0.1052 a.u.
MP2/aug-cc-pVTZ: 0.0955 a.u.
B3LYP/aug-cc-pVTZ: 0.0985 a.u.
MP2/aug-cc-pVDZ: 0.0939 a.u.
B3LYP/aug-cc-pVDZ: 0.0980 a.u.
The Vn produced at MP2/aug-cc-pVDZ (0.0939) is very close to the value we obtained above at
MP4(SDQ)/aug-cc-pVTZ (0.0933), while the computational cost is reduced by factors of two. So, in practical studies,
