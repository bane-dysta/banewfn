4.15 Fuzzy atomic space analysis
Introduction of basic concepts of fuzzy atomic space has been given in Section 3.18.0. In this
section, a few examples will be given to illustrate some capabilities of the fuzzy atomic space
analysis module. In most cases the default Becke’s definition of fuzzy atomic spaces will be
employed, because it is easy to compute and reasonable for most case. However, Hirshfeld-I and
MBIS atomic spaces are more robust and evidently better in certain cases, but they need to perform
iterations to refine atomic spaces, which is somewhat expensive for large systems. You can choose
definition of atomic spaces used in the fuzzy analysis module by option -1.

4.15.1 Study delocalization index of benzene
The definition of delocalization index (DI) has been detailedly introduced in Section 3.18.5.
DI was originally proposed for AIM atomic space, while it has been shown that if it is calculated in
fuzzy atomic space, the computational cost would be significantly reduced, while the result is still
meaningful. In the present instance we will calculate DI in Becke's fuzzy atomic space to study the
extent of electron delocalization between different atomic pairs in benzene.
Boot up Multiwfn, and input following commands
examples\benzene.wfn // Generated under B3LYP/6-311G*
15 // Fuzzy atomic space analysis
4 // Calculate localization index (LI) and DI. Multiwfn first makes use of DFT numerical
quadrature scheme to calculate atomic overlap matrix (AOM) in each fuzzy atomic space, and then
convert AOM to DI and LI.
n // Do not output LI and DI to plain text file
Multiwfn automatically checks and output the error of AOM, for present calculation the error is less than 0.001,
which is completely negligible. If the error is too larger to be accepted, you can set "iautointgrid" in settings.ini to 0,
and set "radpot" and "sphpot" to a large value. When "iautointgrid" is equal to 1, Multiwfn uses (40,230) grid points
to calculate AOM, accuracy of which directly affects the accuracy of LI, DI, as well as of PDI and FLU.

From the DI matrix outputted on the screen, we can see that DI between adjacent two carbon
atoms (e.g. 1-2) and adjacent C-H atoms (e.g. 1-7) are large (1.467 and 0.877, respectively), that
means electron delocalization between bonded atoms is strong, this is mainly due to the shared
electron of σ bond. In contrast, the DI between non-bonded carbon atoms is very small, about 0.1,
nevertheless evidently not zero, reflecting the high-degree delocalization nature of π electrons.
The DI calculated in fuzzy atomic space is essentially the fuzzy bond order proposed by Mayer.
According the DI data, we can say that the bond order between C-C bond and C-H bond in benzene
is 1.467 and 0.877 respectively, the former corresponds to single σ bond + "semi" π bond, while the
latter corresponds to typical single σ bond.
Since benzene is an exactly planar molecule, we can decompose DI to DI-σ and DI-π. Here we
calculate the latter. Input 0 to return to main menu, and then following commands
6 //Modify wavefunction
26 //Modify occupation number
0 // Select all orbitals
0 // Make occupation number of all orbitals to zero
17,20,21 // MO 17,20,21 correspond to π orbitals.
2 // Set their occupation numbers to 2 (closed-shell orbitals)

q // Return to upper level of menu
-1 //Return to main menu
Now recalculate DI as before, since the occupation numbers of all orbitals except π orbitals
have been set to zero, the result will be DI-π.

The DI-π between C1-C6, C1-C5 and C1-C4 are 0.438, 0.055 and 0.093 respectively, it is
obvious that π electron delocalization is larger for para-related than for meta-related carbon atoms.

4.15.2 Study aromaticity of phenanthrene by PDI, FLU, FLU-π and
PLR
PDI, FLU, FLU-π and PLR are useful aromaticity indices, their definitions have been
introduced in Section 3.18.6, 3.18.7 and 3.18.9. In present instance, we will calculate them in
Becke's fuzzy atomic space to study aromaticity of different rings of phenanthrene.

Calculate PDI
We first calculate PDI. Boot up Multiwfn, and input following commands:
examples\phenanthrene.wfn // Optimized at B3LYP/6-31G* level
15 // Fuzzy atomic space analysis
5 // Calculate PDI
Then Multiwfn starts to calculate atomic overlap matrix (AOM), this is a computationally
intensive work. After that AOM will be converted to delocalization index (DI), then DI matrix will
be outputted on screen. Finally, you will be prompted to input atom indices of the ring you are
interested in, the input order should be in consistency with atomic connectivity. We first calculate
PDI of the central ring, namely input 4,8,9,10,7,3, the result is
Delocalization index of

4(C )

10(C ):

0.052992

Delocalization index of

8(C )

7(C ):

0.052992

Delocalization index of

9(C )

--

3(C ):

0.036334

PDI value is

0.047439

PDI value is just the average of the DIs between C4-C10, C8-C7 and C9-C3. Now we input
8,9,11,13,14,15 to calculate PDI of the boundary ring, the result is 0.0817. From this result it is
evident that the electron delocalization in the boundary rings is stronger than in the central ring, so

723

boundary rings possess larger aromaticity. Next, we use FLU and FLU-π to study the aromaticity,
and check if we can draw the same conclusion.
Calculate FLU
Input q to return to upper level of menu, and input 6 to calculate FLU, then input 4,8,9,10,7,3
and 8,9,11,13,14,15 in turn. The FLU of central ring and of boundary rings are 0.025289 and
0.007499, respectively, this result suggests that the boundary rings is more like to typical aromatic
system (benzene), and hence possesses larger aromaticity than the central ring. Note that since the
AOM has already been calculated during calculating PDI, so this time the calculation process of
AOM is automatically skipped.
Calculate FLU-π
Next, input q to return to upper level of menu, and input 7 to calculate FLU-π. First you need
to input the indices of π orbitals. By visually checking isosurface of all orbitals (or utilizing option
22 in main function 100), we know that 36, 40, 43, 44, 45, 46, and 47 are π orbitals, so here we input
36,40,43,44,45,46,47, then DI of π electrons will be outputted. After that you will be prompted to
input the atom indices in the ring, we input 4,8,9,10,7,3 and 8,9,11,13,14,15 in turn. The FLU-π of
central ring and boundary rings are 0.149238 and 0.034904, respectively. Obviously, FLU-π analysis
also confirms that boundary ring is more aromatic.
Calculate PLR
Finally, let us calculate para linear response index (PLR). PLR is based on linear response
kernel, which relies on virtual MOs information; however .wfn file only contains occupied MOs,
therefore we must use .mwfn/.fch/.molden/.gms file as input. Reboot Multiwfn and input following
commands
examples\phenanthrene.fch // Obtained at the same level as phenanthrene.wfn
15 // Fuzzy space analysis
10 // Calculate PLR
Multiwfn will calculate condensed linear response kernel (CLRK) matrix, after that input
4,8,9,10,7,3 and 8,9,11,13,14,15 in turn, the results are 0.248030 and 0.489560, respectively. Since
the former is much smaller than the latter, PLR also validates the conclusion that boundary rings
have larger aromaticity than central ring.
Note that both PDI and PLR can be separated as  and π parts to respectively investigate  and
π aromaticity, see Section 3.18.6 and 3.18.9 for detail.

4.15.3 Calculate fragment dipole moment to exhibit local polarity
Note: Chinese version of this topic is my blog article “Calculation of dipole moment of molecular fragments and
dipole moment of monomers in complexes using Multiwfn “ (http://sobereva.com/558, in Chinese), which contains
additional example and extended discussion.

Dipole moment of a fragment may be defined as

DF =   Z AR A −  wA (r )  (r )r d r 


AF
where A is atomic index in the fragment F, ZA and RA are nuclear charge and position of atom A,
respectively. wA(r) is atomic weighting function of atom A.
As mentioned in Section 3.18.3, Multiwfn is able to calculate atomic and molecular

dipole/multipole moments; if you define an atom list, then the outputted molecular dipole and
multipole moments will correspond to the moments of the fragment. In this calculation, we use this
feature to calculate respective dipole moment of the two monomers in phenol dimer. We will use
Hirshfeld weighting function, since its calculation is easy and its physical meaning is relatively clear.
Boot up Multiwfn and input below commands
examples\phenoldimer.wfn // Wavefunction file of optimized phenol dimer
15 // Fuzzy atomic space analysis
-1 // Select method for defining atomic space
3 // Hirshfeld based on built-in spherically averaged atomic densities
2 // Calculate atomic and molecular multipole moments
1 // Output result on screen
Then Multiwfn starts to calculate population number, dipole and multipole moments of every atom,
and finally prints the data for the whole system (the "molecular" in this context corresponds to the
entire current system):

showing that the dipole moment of the first phenol is (0.570356,-0.356257,0.284025) a.u., and the
phenol carries net charge of -0.096.
Then we input
-5 // Define the atoms to be calculated
14-26 // Atom indices of the second phenol
2 // Calculate atomic and molecular multipole moments
1 // Output result on screen
You will find the second phenol has dipole moment of (0.656950 0.228171 0.366808) a.u.
In summary, now we have three dipole moments:
• dimer: (1.227306,-0.128087,0.650833) a.u.
• 1st phenol: (0.570356,-0.356257,0.284025) a.u.
• 2nd phenol: (0.656950,0.228171,0.366808) a.u.
For easily visual inspection, we will plot the dipole moments as arrows in VMD visualization
program, which can be freely obtained at http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/. The version I am
using is VMD 1.9.3. Since VMD is unable to load .wfn file, we need to convert the present system
to .xyz file. To do so, we return to main menu, enter main function 100 and choose subfunction 2,
then you will find corresponding option used to export .xyz file. We export the present system as
phenoldimer.xyz.
Boot up VMD and then load the phenoldimer.xyz into it. Copying all information from
examples\scripts\drawarrow.tcl script file to VMD console window to run it, a new custom
command "drawarrow" will be defined, which will be used to plot arrows. Then we input below
commands to VMD console:
draw color green
drawarrow all 1.227306 -0.128087 0.650833 2
draw color red
drawarrow "serial 1 to 13" 0.570356 -0.356257 0.284025 2
draw color yellow
drawarrow "serial 14 to 26" 0.656950 0.228171 0.366808 2

That means dipole moment of the whole system (selected by "all") will be plotted by green arrow,
that of the 1st and 2nd phenol molecules will be plotted by red and yellow arrows, respectively. The
"serial 1 to 13" and "serial 14 to 26" are selection syntax in VMD. The argument "2" at the end of
the commands makes the length of the arrows doubled, so that the dipole moments can be
represented by the arrows clearly.

4 Tutorials and Examples
After some adjustments of graphical effect (e.g. setting drawing method as "licorice" in
"Graphics" - "Representation" interface), you can see below map. The center of the red, yellow and
green arrows are placed at geometric centers of the two phenols and the dimer, respectively; the
arrow lengths correspond to the norm of the dipole moments (multiplied by 2).

Since the dipole moment vectors of the two monomers are nearly parallel with each other, their
vector sum, namely the dipole moment of the dimer, is significantly larger than the monomer dipole
moments.
Bear in mind that fragment dipole moment relies on the choice of origin if the net charge of
the fragment is not zero. For the present example, due to marginal charge transfer between the two
phenol molecules, the monomer dipole moment must be slightly dependent of origin. However this
is not an evident problem since the net charge of the monomer is quite small and the current origin
is appropriate (at nuclear charge center of the dimer).

4.15.4 Calculate atomic effective, free volumes, atomic polarizability
and atomic C6 coefficient: Oxirane and SiH4 as examples
See my blog article “Calculating atomic polarizabilities in molecules using Multiwfn” (http://sobereva.com/600,
in Chinese) and “Using Multiwfn to calculate atomic C6 dispersion coefficients” (http://sobereva.com/709, in
Chinese) for more discussion and examples.

Please read Section 3.18.12 first if you do not know what is atomic effective volume (Veff),
atomic free volume (Vfree), atomic static polarizability (eff(0)) and atomic C6 coefficient (C6,AA). In
this section we will calculate them for two common molecules.
Part 1: Atomic effective/free/polarizability of oxirane
In this example we focus on evaluating Vfree and eff(0) for atoms in oxirane (C2OH4). Its
wavefunction file is examples\oxirane.fchk, which was generated by Gaussian 16 at B3LYP/6-31G*
level.
Prior to using Multiwfn to calculate aforementioned quantities, we need to manually generate
wavefunction file of all elements (C, O, H) in the present system at the same level as molecular
calculation. You can use your favourite quantum chemistry program for this step. The wavefunction
files in .wfn format (H.wfn, C.wfn and O.wfn) generated by Gaussian 16 at B3LYP/6-31G* level
can be directly downloaded here: http://sobereva.com/multiwfn/extrafiles/oxirane_atmvol.zip,
Gaussian input files are also provided. Note that the atomic wavefunction files are not necessarily

Sum of atomic polarizabilities:

27.800 a.u.

...[ignored]

It can be seen that Veff of most atoms are notably reduced compared to Vfree, implying that in
molecular environment the polarizability of these atoms are decreased compared to free state,
because it is well-known that there is an approximate positive correlation between volume and
polarizability.
The polarizabilities of atoms in their free states (free(0)) are built-in data in Multiwfn and
printed as “Ref. data” in above output. The atomic polarizabilities in oxirane, eff(0), estimated using
the Tkatchenko-Scheffler method is simply product of Veff/Vfree and free(0). As shown, the sum of
all eff(0) values is 27.8 a.u., which is in good agreement with molecular polarizability of oxirane
estimated at MP2/aug-cc-pVTZ level based on current geometry (28.8 a.u.).
The sum of all eff(0) is not necessarily always close to molecular polarizability, and the
deviation is very sensitive to the choice of atomic weighting function. For example, if you select
option -1 in the fuzzy analysis interface and choose Hirshfeld partition instead of the default Becke
partition, the sum of all eff(0) will be as high as 37.9 a.u. In this case, the “Contribution” printed
by Multiwfn (%), which is ratio of eff(0) of an atom to sum of all eff(0), will be more useful, as
its sensitivity is lower and can be used to intuitively analyze main source of molecular polarizability.

For example, according to percentage atomic contribution printed by Multiwfn, we can find carbon
atoms have very large contribution (each of them contributes 29% to molecular polarizability).
It is worth to mention that if interatomic interaction is extremely weak, the Veff should be very
close to Vfree. For example, Veff of Ar atom in Ar2 dimer is almost identical to Vfree of Ar.
There is another way of evaluating atomic volumes in practical chemical environment, namely
performing basin analysis for electron density. This idea comes from atoms-in-molecules (AIM)
theory. Example can be found in Section 4.17.1.
Part 2: C6 coefficients of SiH4
In this example we focus on evaluating atomic C6 coefficients and homomolecular C6
coefficient in SiH4. According to the benchmark in Section 5 of MBIS original paper (J. Chem.
Theory Comput., 12, 3894 (2016)), MBIS atomic space performs best in combination with
B3LYP/6-311+G(2df,p) level to evaluate molecular C6 coefficients using the Tkatchenko-Scheffler
method. So, in this example we also employ this scheme. The .fch file of SiH4 as well as .wfn file
of Si and H atoms calculated at B3LYP/6-311+G(2df,p) level have been provided in
“examples\SiH4_C6\” folder.
Boot up Multiwfn and input
examples\SiH4_C6\SiH4.fch
15 // Fuzzy analysis
-1 // Select the method for partitioning atomic spaces
5 // MBIS
1 // Start calculation. Then MBIS atomic spaces will be constructed
13 // Calculate atomic effective volume, free volume, polarizability and C6 coefficient
examples\SiH4_C6\H.wfn // Wavefunction file of H atom in isolated state
examples\SiH4_C6\Si.wfn // Wavefunction file of Si atom in isolated state
You will see the following output along with
Atomic C6 coefficients estimated using Tkatchenko-Scheffler method:
1(Si):

118.31 a.u. (Ref. data:

305.0 a.u.)

2(H ):

3(H ):

4(H ):

3.83 a.u. (Ref. data:

6.5 a.u.)

5(H ):

3.83 a.u. (Ref. data:

6.5 a.u.)

Note: Reference data denotes the built-in value of free-state atom
Homomolecular C6 coefficient:

347.07 a.u.

You can see C6 coefficient of each atom in SiH4. According to their magnitude, clearly the Si
atom contributes to dispersion effect significantly more than H atoms. The “Ref. data” denotes C6
coefficients of atoms in their isolated state and are taken from literature. It is seen that Multiwfn
also calculated and printed homomolecular C6 coefficient for SiH4, which corresponds to the C6
coefficient used to calculate dispersion interaction between two SiH4 molecules. The present value
347.07 a.u. is in very good agreement with the 343.9 a.u. given in Table I of J. Chem. Phys., 123,
024101 (2005)! However, it should be noted that the molecular C6 coefficient calculated in this way
is not always quite accurate, sometimes the relative error may be close to 10% or even more. In
addition, it should be recognized that MBIS does not perform best in all cases; for some molecules,

Please check Section 3.18.3 to understand definition of atomic electric dipole moment (A) and
atomic electric quadrupole moment (A). These two quantities convey important information about
electron density distribution around nuclei under a given atomic space partition scheme. In the
examples in the next two sections, we will calculate and then visualize them in VMD program via
a special script, you will find they are pretty intuitive and important in understanding status of atoms
in actual chemical environment.

4.15.5.1 Plotting atomic dipole moments
Here I use H2O2 molecule as an instance to show how to calculate and plot atomic dipole
moments in VMD program. VMD can be freely obtained at http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/,
the version I used in this example is 1.9.3.
Boot up Multiwfn and input
examples\H2O2.fch
15 // Fuzzy atomic space analysis module
2 // Calculate atomic and molecular multipole moments and <r^2>
2 // Output result to a plain text file
Now you have multiple.txt and atom_moment.txt in current folder. The former contains detailed
information about atomic multipole moments (from monopole moment to octopole moment), while
the latter contains atomic dipole moments as well as eigenvalues and eigenvectors of atomic
quadrupole moment tensors.
In order to plot atomic dipole moment vectors along with molecular structure in VMD, we
need to export the geometry loaded from the H2O2.fch to H2O2.xyz by inputting the following
command
0 // Return to main menu
100 // Other functions (Part 1)
2 // Export file
2 // Output current structure to .xyz file
[Press ENTER button] // Use default file name
Now you have H2O2.xyz in current folder.
Boot up VMD, load the H2O2.xyz. Then move both atom_moment.txt and the VMD plotting
script atomdip.tcl in “examples\scripts\” folder to VMD folder. Next, input the following commands
in VMD console window, the first command executes the script, which defines a plotting function,
while the second command runs the plotting function with default parameters.
source atomdip.tcl
atomdip
Now you can find atomic dipole moment information (in a.u.) in VMD console window:

In VMD graphical window you can see

The yellow arrows correspond to A vectors of every atom, pointing from negative charge
center to positive charge center in corresponding atomic space, and their lengths are proportional to
magnitude of A. The direction of the arrow on the oxygen atoms in the figure is easy to understand.
It is well known that the oxygen in H2O2 has obvious lone pair electrons, and the lone pair region
carries a dense negative charge, while the positive charge in the atomic space is only contributed by
the nuclear charge, so the arrow must approximately point from the lone pair region to the nucleus.
Adjusting graphical effect
The graphical effect can be adjusted. For example, in “Graphics” - “Representation” panel you
can set drawing method as CPK and properly define thickness of bonds and radius of atom spheres.
Then inputting following command in VMD console window to change background color and
material of plotted objects
color Display Background white
draw material GlassBubble
Now you can see the following image

Note that the “atomdip” command has some optional parameters to control color, length, radius
of arrows as well as the range of considered atoms, please check beginning of the atomdip.tcl file.
As an example, if you input atomdip “serial 1 to 2 4” orange 5 0.05, arrows will be plotted only
for atoms 1, 2, 4 with orange color, and the arrow length is longer than default while the arrow
thickness is smaller than default.
Using different atomic space partition schemes
Dipole moment of some atoms in certain chemical environment is highly sensitive to the choice
of partition of atomic spaces. You can also use other definition of atomic spaces other than the
default Becke’s definition. In fuzzy atomic space analysis module, you can use option -1 to change

definition of partition.
As illustrated in Section 4.17.1, if you generate basins for electron density (i.e. AIM partition),
then subfunction 8 in basin analysis module is able to calculate atomic multipole moments, and if
you input y after the calculation, atom_moment.txt will be exported, based on which you can plot
atomic dipole moments under AIM partition via the aforementioned procedure. You will find the
direction of the arrows on oxygens in the H2O2 changes a lot (which, in my opinion, is not as
satisfactory as Becke’s partition).

4.15.5.2 Plotting atomic quadrupole moments
In this example, we visualize atomic quadrupole moments of C6H5Br in VMD, the data will be
calculated under Becke’s partition like the last section. The corresponding wavefunction file
examples\C6H5Br.mwfn was generated at B3LYP/def-TZVP level.
Boot up Multiwfn and load examples\C6H5Br.mwfn, then use exactly the same steps as the last
section to generate atom_moment.txt and C6H5Br.xyz. Move the atom_moment.txt as well as
atomquad.tcl in “examples\scripts\” folder to VMD folder. Boot up VMD, load the C6H5Br.xyz,
then run the following two commands in VMD console window to activate plotting script and run
the plotting command
source atomquad.tcl
atomquad
After some adjustments on graphical effect, you can see

The yellow ellipsoid over each atom intuitively characterizes traceless Cartesian atomic
electric quadrupole moment tensor A. The shape of the ellipsoid is determined by directions of
three principal axes (eigenvectors of A) and semi-axis lengths, which are printed in VMD console
window after running the “atomquad” command:
Information of atom 1
Principal axis 1:

1.000

0.000

0.000

Semi-axis length:

0.162

Principal axis 2:

0.000

-0.880

0.475

Semi-axis length:

0.405

Principal axis 3:

0.000

0.475

0.880

Semi-axis length:

0.432

...[ignored]

The ellipsoid semi-axis lengths {l} are determined via the following way proposed by me.
Given that eigenvalues of A, namely {v}, may be negative, in order to make visualization feasible,
they are first transformed to values equal or larger than 1 via the following equation

ti = 1 + vi − vmin

i = 1,2,3

where vmin is the most negative eigenvalue. Then {l} are evaluated as

li = s

ti
t1 + t2 + t3

i = 1,2,3

Clearly, the sum of the three semi-axis lengths equals to s, which is the scale factor controlling size
of the ellipsoid, and can be set by an optional parameter of the “atomquad” command. The default
value s=1 is suitable for most cases.
According to the physical meaning of A (see Section 3.18.3), it is easy to understand that the
shorter the length of the ellipsoid in a certain direction, the more extended the electron density
distribution in that direction, and vice versa. Therefore, from the shape of the ellipsoids in the above
image, one can easily conclude that electron distribution of the carbon atoms is highly elongated in
the direction perpendicular to the six-membered ring possibly due to the rich  electrons. For the Br
atom, the electron density is remarkably contracted along the C-Br bond, this observation
corresponds to the well-known -hole character.
The “atomquad” command has many optional parameters controlling the plotting effect, please
check comments at beginning of the atomquad.tcl file.
In above illustration the mode 1 of the “atomquad” command was used, while by mode 2, the
shape of the plotted ellipsoids can intuitively portray elongation tendency of electron density in
atomic spaces. For example, by running atomquad noh green 1 2 50 in VMD console window, green
ellipsoids will be drawn over all non-hydrogen atoms with scale factor of 1 and resolution of 50
using mode 2, then you can see the following figure

The semi-axis lengths of the ellipsoids in above map are positively correlated to the extension extent
of electron distribution in corresponding direction within atomic space. Specifically, the semi-axis
lengths are evaluated in the same way as mentioned earlier but with different definition of {t},
namely

ti =

1
1 + vi − vmin

i = 1,2,3

Above figure essentially conveys exactly the same information as the figure given earlier, but
obviously this figure is more convenient for visual analysis of electron distribution. For example, it
is clearly seen that in the space of Br atom, the electron density is more extended in the plane
perpendicular to the C-Br bond axis.
