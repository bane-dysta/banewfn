2 is solid (occupied). In fact, there is no need to view the alpha and beta orbital interaction diagrams
as two different maps, you can think that actually there is only one orbital interaction diagram, in
which the orbitals 1~4 of fragments 1 and 2 are doubly occupied, while the orbital 5 of fragment 1
is unpaired alpha electron orbital and orbital 5 of fragment 2 is unpaired beta electron orbital.
It is worth to note that if you plot this orbital interaction diagram based on ROKS fragment
orbitals, you will find that for each spin, complex orbitals are not always equally contributed by
fragments orbitals of the two fragments despite the two methyl groups are chemically equivalent,
this is because alpha and beta ROKS orbitals do not share identical energies and shapes. Obviously,
analyzing based on ROKS orbitals makes discussion markedly easier than based on UKS orbitals,
for which you have to study interaction diagram of alpha and beta spins respectively.

4.17 Basin analysis
Note: Some examples in this section are also available in my blog article “Using Multiwfn to perform basin
analysis for electron density, ELF, electrostatic potential, density difference and other functions”
(http://sobereva.com/179, in Chinese).

Below I will show how to use basin analysis module of Multiwfn to perform basin analysis for
several molecules and for various real space functions. Related theory, numerical algorithms and
the usage of this module have been detailedly introduced in Section 3.20. If you are not familiar
with the concept of basin, please consult Section 3.20.1 first. While if you want to know more detail
about basin analysis, please consult Sections 3.20.2 and 3.20.3.
You should know that Multiwfn uses a grid-based method (in particular, near-grid method) to
locate attractors, generate and integrate basins; in other words, most tasks realized in the basin
analysis module rely on grid data. This is why in below sections "grid data" is frequently mentioned.

4.17.1 AIM basin analysis for HCN and Li6
In this example we will analyze basins of electron density (also known as AIM basins) for
HCN molecule, which is a very representative molecule. Only at final part of this section, I will also
show how to carry out basin analysis of electron density for Li6 atomic cluster, since this is a special
case, in which there are some "pseudoatoms".
After you carefully read this section, I believe you will understand most of basic operations of
the basin analysis module in Multiwfn.
Generate basins and locate attractors
Boot up Multiwfn and input following commands
examples\HCN.wfn
17 // Basin analysis
1 // Generate basins and locate attractors
1 // The grid data to be calculated and thus analyzed is for electron density
2 // Medium quality grid. This is enough for most cases, if you want to obtain a better result,
you can choose "High quality grid", but much more computational time will be spent
Multiwfn now starts to calculate grid data for electron density, and then generates basins and
locates attractors based on the grid data; soon you will see attractor information, as shown below

From now on you can check the information of the located attractors anytime by option -3.
Visualization of basins and attractors
Now choose option 0 to visualize the basins and attractors. The purple labels indicate the index
of the located attractors. Since attractors of electron density are very close to nuclei, if you want to
see them, you should deselect "Show molecule" check box first. Here we select 1 from the basin list
at the right-bottom corner, the basin corresponding to attractor 1 will be immediately shown. By
default only interbasin part of the basin is shown, if you want to inspect the whole basin you should
select "Show basin interior" checkbox. After we select it, the GUI will look like below:

If you only want to visualize the region of the atomic basin in the vdW surface (defined as

=0.001 a.u. in the present context), you can choose "Set basin drawing method" - "rho>0.001
region only", then you can see:

Now click "RETURN" button to close the GUI.
You may have noticed below information in the command-line window
The number of unassigned grids:

0

The number of grids travelled to box boundary:

0

Commonly the number of these two types of grid should be zero, only in rare cases they are not
zero; in such cases, you can visualize them by respectively selecting "Unas" and "Boun" in the basin
list of the GUI. These grids do not belong to any basin, and generally they lack of physical meaning;
to understand when and why they occur please consult Section 3.20.2.
Integrating basins
Next, we calculate the integral of electron density (electron population number) in these basins.
Select function 2, then you will see many options. Each option with the serial  1 corresponds to a
real space function; if you select one of them, corresponding real space function will be integrated
in the generated basins. In present example we can select option 1, which corresponds to electron
density. However, since we have already calculated grid data for electron density, and the grid data
of electron density thus have been stored in memory, we can directly use it rather than compute it
again to reduce computational time, so here we select option 0 to use "The values of the grid data
stored in memory". Since electron density at the grids is not needed to be re-evaluated, the integrals
are outputted immediately:
#Basin

Sum of above values:

13.98879137

There should be totally 1+6+7=14 electrons in present system; unfortunately, the sum of the
integrals of electron density is 13.98879, which evidently deviates from the ideal value!
Because the basin we are studying is AIM basin, the best choice to obtain the basin integral is
using function 7 rather than function 2. In function 7, mixed atomic-center and uniform grid is used,
while function 2 only employs uniform grid to integrate. We input:
7 // Integrate real space functions in AIM basins with mixed type of grids
1 // Integrate a specific function with atomic-center + uniform grids
1 // Select electron density as the integrand
The result is
#Basin

Sum of basin volumes (rho>0.001):

As you can see, the sum of the integrals of electron density (13.999) is almost exactly identical
to the expected value 14.0, obviously the result is much better than using function 2. The basin
volumes are also outputted. The terms "vol(Bohr^2)" do not have clear physical meaning, since they
are directly affected by the spatial range of grid setting. However, the terms "vol(rho>0.001)" are
useful, they exhibit the volume of the basin enclosed by the isosurface of electron density > 0.001

The atomic charge (AIM charge) of these atoms and their volumes are also outputted

Note that above AIM charges are not very accurate! To obtain more accurate integrals in AIM
basins, you should select option 2 or 3 in function 7; compared to 1, they will refine the assignment
of basin boundary to conspicuously improve the integration accuracy, but additional computational
cost must be afforded. Here we try it, select option 2 in function 7, then input 1, the result is
Normalization factor of the integral of electron density is

0.999967

3 (H )

Charge:

Volume:

35.480 Bohr^3

It is seen that the atomic charges are varied compared to earlier (more accurate than before).
To further improve the integration accuracy, when generating basins one should select a grid
setting better than "medium quality grid", e.g. "High quality grid" or even "Lunatic quality grid".
But bear in mind that for large systems, high quality grid may consume very large amount of
computational time and memory, and lunatic quality grid needs more.
Although as we have seen the integration accuracy of function 7 (uniform + atomic center
integration grid) is much better than function 2 (purely uniform integration grid), the former is only
applicable to integrate AIM basins, while the latter can be used for any type of basin (e.g. ELF basin).
Note: If you used option 2 or 3 in function 7, during the boundary grid refinement process, the assignment of
basin boundary will be updated permanently, that means the result of subsequent analyses (e.g. calculating LI/DI,
electric multipole moment) will also become more accurate.

In summary, the common steps for obtaining reliable AIM charges after you entered basin
analysis module is
1 // Generate basin
1 // Electron density
2 // Medium quality grid. Select high quality grid if you wish to get more accurate result
7 // Integrate real space functions in AIM basins with mixed type of grids
2 // Integrate and meantime refine basin boundary
1 // Electron density
Calculate electric multipole moments of basins
Now enter function 8 to calculate electric multipole moments for the AIM basins using mixed
grid (you can also use function 3 to do this based on uniform grid, but the accuracy is significantly
poorer). Only the result of carbon is pasted below

The formulae used to evaluate these terms are basically the same as those given in Section
3.18.3, however, the nuclear positions should be replaced by attractor positions, and the spatial
ranges of the integration should be basins rather than fuzzy atomic spaces.
The electric monopole moment (-5.251 a.u.) is just the negative value of electron population
in the basin. Z-component of electric dipole moment of the basin is a positive value (1.096 a.u.),
suggesting that in basin 2, most of electrons are distributed in the regions where Z-coordinate is
more negative than attractor 2. The ZZ-component of basin electric quadrupole moment is positive
(1.519 a.u.), while the other diagonal components are negative, indicating that relative to attractor
2, electron cloud in this basin contracts in Z-direction but elongates in other directions.
The <r2> exhibits spatial extent of electron distribution in the atomic basins. From the output
you can find the order of this value is N2 (14.37) > H3 (1.04) > C1 (8.54), indicating that the nitrogen
and hydrogen have the widest and narrowest electronic spatial extent, respectively.
Calculate localization index and delocalization index of basins
Delocalization index (DI) is a quantitative measure of the number of electrons delocalized (or
say shared) between two regions, while localization index (LI) quantitatively measures how many
electrons are localized in a region. For details about LI and DI please see Section 3.18.5. The only
difference relative to the statements in that section is that here the LI and DI will be calculated based
on basins rather than based on fuzzy atomic spaces.
Choose function 4, then select option 2 to use mixed grid to evaluate basin overlap matrix, then
LI and DI will also be calculated. As you can see from screen, the LI and DI matrix are outputted
first based on basin indices, after that, Multiwfn identifies correspondence between atom indices
and basin indices, then prints LI and DI matrix based on atom indices, as shown below

Since present molecule is a closed-shell system, only total LI and DI are outputted, the LI and
DI for  and  electrons are not outputted separately. As you can see, between C1 and N2 atomic
basins, the DI is 2.592, exhibiting that there are 2.592 electrons effectively shared by the two atoms.
To some extent DI can be regarded as covalent bond order, the DI value 2.592 is indeed comparable
with the formal bond order (3.0) between C and N in HCN. The diagonal terms are the sums of the
elements in corresponding row/column, for closed-shell cases they can be somewhat considered as
atomic valence. So we can say the N2 atom in HCN has atomic valence of 2.665.
The LI of H3 is only 0.256, which conspicuously deviates from the basin electron population.
This observation reflects that in HCN, the electron in the AIM atomic space of hydrogen can easily
delocalize out.
Special case: Basin analysis when pseudoatoms are presented
Pseudoatom is also known as non-nuclear attractor (NNA) of electron density, it refers to
maximum of electron density that are not at nuclear position. There are various reasons that can
cause the NNAs, for example, existence of metal bond or quality of wavefunction is too poor. Here
I use Li6 cluster as example to illustrate how to deal with the case when NNAs are presented.
Boot up Multiwfn and input
examples\Li6.fch

1 // Generate basins and locate attractors
1 // Electron density

0 // Visualize attractors and basins
Left part of below graph shows geometry of the cluster, the three green spheres indicate
position of the three NNAs; right part of the graph displays corresponding basin of one of NNAs.
As you can see, attractors 2, 4, 8 are NNAs.

If you plot color-filled map of valence electron density for the Li6 via the steps illustrated in
Section 4.6.2, you will immediately understand why there exists NNAs at center of the boundary Li

triangles. From below graph you can clearly see that at center of each boundary triangle there is
indeed a maximum of electron density, this observation also implies presence of three-center bonds

Next, we calculate population number of the AIM basins. Input below commands
7 // Integrate real space functions in AIM basins with mixed type of grids
2 // Integrate and meantime refine basin boundary
1 // Electron density
During integrating the basins, calculation will pause three times and meantime you will find
prompt like below on screen. This is because program does not know how to properly deal with the
three NNAs, namely attractors 2, 4, 8:
Warning: Unable to determine the attractor

2 belongs to which atom!

If this is a non-nuclear attractor, simply press ENTER button to continue. If you used
pseudopotential and this attractor corresponds to the cluster of all maxima of its valence
electron, then input the index of this atom (e.g. 9). Else you should input q to return
and regenerate basins with smaller grid spacing

Since we already know that attractors 2, 4, 8 are regular NNAs, according to the prompt, what
we should do is simply pressing ENTER button to continue the calculation. Finally, you will find
below output

As can be seen, each NNA basin carries 1.249 electrons, therefore charge of the basin is -1.249.
When NNAs are presented, it is clearly unable to rigorously define AIM atomic charges, since sum
of all AIM atomic charges will be unequal to net charge of the whole system. This is one of severe
limitations of AIM atomic charge.
Drawing basins via VMD program
When showing basins, you can easily get much better graphical effect if you make use of VMD
program. See this video illustration: "Drawing AIM basins (atomic basins) in Multiwfn and VMD"
(https://youtu.be/9D5do80XcbI).
Briefly speaking, what you need to do is selecting option -5 in the basin analysis module, input
indices of the basins of interest, and then choose "3 Output all basin grids where electron density >
0.001 a.u." to export the basins as individual cube files. Then loading them into VMD and plot them
as isosurfaces with isovalue=0.5, you can get a graph like the following one (oxygen basin of
examples\acrolein.wfn):

As illustrated in the aforementioned video tutorial, you can even simultaneously draw multiple
basins and show critical points + bond paths in VMD. For example, below map represents atomic
basins of four non-hydrogen atoms of acrolein, the orange and purple spheres correspond to bond
critical points and nuclear critical points, respectively. The yellow thick lines are bond paths.

4.17.2 Example of ELF basin analysis
Multiwfn is very powerful in ELF basin analysis. As an example, in this section we analyze
ELF basin for a typical small molecule, acetylene. Boot up Multiwfn and input

examples\C2H2.wfn
17 // Basin analysis
1 // Generate basins and locate attractors
9 // ELF
2 // Medium quality grid
Once generation of basins has completed, we can perform various kind of visualization and
analyses, see below.
Part 1: Visualize attractors and basins
We enter option 0 to visualize ELF attractors and basins, you will see the following map. The
attractors are represented as green spheres, and the purple texts are basin indices. You can find there
are lots of closely placed attractors encircling the C-C bond, they have basically identical ELF values
and collectively represent the ring-like ELF attractor. These attractors have been clustered together
by Multiwfn automatically, therefore all of them have the same attractor index, namely 2; in other
words, attractor 2 is a degenerate attractor, which contains many member attractors (or pristine
attractors). Correspondingly, basin 2 is composed of all member basins.

You can choose 2 in the list at bottom-right of the GUI to visualize basin 2, you can see

Sometimes it is better to only visualize the basin region where electron density is higher than
0.001 a.u. To do this, select “Set basin drawing method” in the menu bar and then choose “rho>0.001
region only”, then click “Show basin interior” check box at right side of the GUI, you will see

All electrons contributing to C1-C3 bond are lying in the basin 2 shown above.
The presence of attractor 2 signifies the π electrons shared by the two carbons. According to
the well-known ELF symbolic scheme, basin 2 should be identified as V(C1,C3), which means this
basin is comprised by valence electrons of C1 and C3 and contribute to existence of C1-C3 bond.
Attractor 3 and 4 correspond to core-type ELF attractors, their basins should be identified as
C(C3) and C(C1), respectively, where the letter C out of parentheses stands for "Core". If you
deselect the "Show molecule" check box and select corresponding terms in the basin list, then you
can visualize the basins. The graph shown below portrays C(C3) basin

Although basins 1 and 5 cover the atomic space of H4 and H2, they should be identified as
V(C3,H4) and V(C1,H2), respectively, rather than C(H4) and C(H2). This is because hydrogen does
not have core electrons, and the electrons in the two basins directly contribute to C3-H4 and C1-H2
bonds.
Now close the GUI window by clicking "RETURN" button at upper right side of GUI.
Part 2: Automatically assigning ELF basin labels
When the system is relatively large, or there are numerous structures to be studied (for example,
in bond evolution theory analysis you need to study a batch of IRC points), manually assigning
labels for ELF basins is quite troublesome. Fortunately, Multiwfn is able to automatically assign
basin labels, as long as the real space function you selected is ELF.
We choose option “12 Assign ELF basin labels”, then you will immediately see

As can be seen above, the data are outputted twice. First, basin population, volume and labels are
printed in the order of basin indices. Then, the basins are sorted according to labels, and the data are
outputted again. From the labels, the physical meaning of each basin can be quickly and clearly
recognized.
Note that ELF basin labels may be unable to correctly assign for atoms using pseudopotential.
Part 3: Estimate basin properties
Multiwfn is able to calculate integral of any real space function in generated basins. For
example, we calculate integral of electron density in every basin, now input
2 // Integrate a real space functions in the basins
1 // Electron density
Soon, we get the integrals, namely the average electron population number in each basin:

Both C(C1) and C(C3) contain 2.095 electrons in average, which is in line with the fact that
carbon has two electrons in its core. Also, the average population number in V(C3,H4) and V(C1,H2)
are close to two, approximately reflecting that in average there is a pair of electron shared between
C and H.
According to classical chemical bond theory there are three electron pairs and hence six

electrons are shared by the two carbons, however in the V(C1,C3) basin the integral is only 5.37.
Although the deviation is relatively large, this is a normal situation. It is senseless to expect that the
result of ELF basin analysis must be able to reproduce classical Lewis picture, and actually, ELF
analysis is more advanced and more close to real physical picture.
Part 4: Electric multipole moments of basins
Electric multipole moments of ELF basins are able to characterize electron distribution in
featured regions. To calculate them, we enter option “3 Calculate electric multipole moments and
<r^2> for basins”. Assume that we need the result for all basins, according to prompt on screen we
input -1. The result for each basin are outputted in turn, the data of basin 4, which corresponds to
C(C1), is given below

First you should note that although in present case, due to the symmetry, the X and Y
components of the basin electric dipole moment should vanish, the actual values are not so close to
zero, implying that the integration accuracy is not very high. This is why "high quality grid" is often
necessary for electric multipole moment analysis. However, the present result is still useful for
qualitative analysis. The magnitude of electric quadrupole moment in the basin quantifies how
evidently the electron distribution in the basin deviates from spherical symmetry. This value for
C(C1) is very small (0.0061), showing that the distribution of core electron of the carbon basically
remains unperturbed during the formation of the molecule.
Now input 0 to return to basin analysis module.
Note: If the basins you are interested in are only valence basins, "medium quality grid" is enough for electric
multipole moment analysis, since valence density is not as high as core density, and hence does not need high
accuracy of integration.

Part 5: Localization index (LI) and delocalization index (DI)
Multiwfn is able to calculate LI for each basin and DI between each pair of basins. Now we
choose option 4 to study LI and DI. The result is shown below

The DI between C(C1) and C(C3), namely DI(3,4), is trivial, reflecting the general rule that the
electron delocalization between atomic core regions is rather difficult. DI(1,3) and DI(2,3) are very
small values but not close to zero, representing that the electrons in C(C3) have a few probability to
exchange with the ones in V(C3,H4) and V(C1,C3), which are the only two basins adjacent to C(C3).
DI(2,1) and DI(2,5) are about 1.0, such a large value indicates that the electron delocalization
between C-C bond region and C-H bond region is easy. Though the average electron population
number in both C(C1) and C(C3) are 2.095, their LI values are as high as 1.834, exhibiting that the
core electrons of carbon highly prefer to stay in the core region rather than delocalize in and out. In
contrast, for V(C,H) and V(C,H), their LI values are less than their average electron population
numbers distinctly, revealing that the electrons in these basins do not express very strong
localization character.
In the ELF basin analyses, some researchers prefer to use the concept of variance (σ2) and
covariance (Cov) rather than LI and DI to discuss problems. Covariance of electron pair fluctuation
is simply the half of the negative value of DI, for example, Cov(2,5) = -DI(2,5)/2 = -1.035/2 = 0.518. The variance of electronic fluctuation can be calculated as the half of the corresponding
diagonal term of the DI matrix outputted by Multiwfn, for instance, σ2(2) = DI(2,2)/2 = 2.710/2 =
1.355 (note that as mentioned earlier, the diagonal terms of the DI matrix outputted by Multiwfn are
the sums of the elements in corresponding row/column).
Part 6: Hint on visualizing attractors in VMD and GaussView
The attractors located by Multiwfn can be visualized via third-part softwares. To visualize them
in VMD (http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/), you should choose "-4 Export attractors as
pdb/pqr/txt/gjf file" and select corresponding option to export all attractors as .pdb or .pqr file, which
can be loaded and plotted VMD (PS: In .pqr file, the atomic charge column corresponds to function
value at the attractor). The atoms and attractors can also be exported as .gjf file using suboption 4,
then you can use GaussView to easily visualize attractors. After loading the .gjf file into GaussView,
it is suggested to choose "File" - "Preference" - "View" - "Display Format" - "Molecule", and then
set low layer as "Tube" style. The attractors are recorded as ghost atom (Bq), their indices in
GaussView minus number of real atoms are the attractor indices in basin analysis module. The
following map shows ELF attractors of CH3NO2 displayed in this way, the labels are not shown:

4.17.3 Basin analysis of electrostatic potential for H2O
In this example I will illustrate performing basin analysis for electrostatic potential (ESP), a
very simple molecule H2O is taken as instance. Although this kind of analysis is currently
uncommon in literatures, you will see this analysis is indeed useful; in particular, this analysis is
able to well reveal occurrence region of lone pairs.
It is noteworthy that unlike electron density and ELF which we have analyzed earlier, ESP has
positive part and negative part simultaneously. For such real space functions, Multiwfn will
automatically locate attractors (maxima) for positive part and locate "repulsors" (minima) for
negative part, but in Multiwfn all of them are collectively recorded as "attractors". You can easily
discriminate them by their colors in GUI.
Not only basin analysis module, but also topology analysis module of Multiwfn can locate
minima of ESP, and the ESP minima determined by the latter is much more accurate. So, using
topology analysis module is much more preferred over than using the way introduced in this section.
See Section 4.2.9 for example of topology analysis of ESP.
Note: Calculation speed of ESP grid data by cubegen utility in Gaussian package is significantly faster than that
of internal code of Multiwfn. If you have Gaussian installed on your system and the input file is .fch/fchk, it is
strongly suggested to set "cubegenpath" parameter in settings.ini to actual path of cubegen, then at the step of
calculating ESP grid data in the basin analysis, cubegen will be automatically invoked by Multiwfn to evaluate ESP.
More information about invoking cubegen can be found in Section 5.7.

Basic steps of performing ESP basin analysis
Boot up Multiwfn and input following commands:
examples\H2O.fch // Optimized and produced at B3LYP/6-31G** level
17 // Basin analysis
1 // Select real space function used to partitioning basins
12 // ESP
2 // Medium quality grid
Once the calculation of ESP grid data and the basin generation are finished, five attractors are
founded. Notice that this time the number of grids travelled to box boundary is not zero again (about
1954 grids), but it completely does not matter.
Choose option 0 to open GUI, you can see that attractors 1, 2 and 3 correspond to ESP maxima
due to nuclear charges. Occurrence of lone pair often makes ESP at corresponding region negative,
clearly attractors 4 and 5 exhibited this effect. Attractors 4 and 5 are colored by light blue because
they are lying in negative region, in fact they are not attractors but "repulsors" (minima) of ESP. By

clicking "4" in the basin list and checking "Show basin interior" box, you will see below graph,
which exhibits the corresponding basin region.

If you want to visualize which grids have travelled to box boundary during basin generation,
you can select "Boun" in the basin list, see below graph. Evidently, these grids lack of physical
meaning and hence can be simply ignored. They only present at the regions far from atoms.

Now click "RETURN" button to close the GUI.
Measuring geometry
Sometimes one needs to obtain geometry information between attractors and nuclei. As an
instance, we enter function -2, and input a1 c4, the distance between nucleus of atom 1 (namely
oxygen) and attractor 4 will be shown on the screen, the value is 2.272 Bohr. Next, input c4 a1 c5,
then the angle of "attractor 2 -- atom 1 -- attractor 3" will be outputted, the value is 86.01 degree,
which in some sense can be regarded as the angle between the two lone pairs.
Input q to exit the geometry measurement interface.
Clustering attractors
Assume that we want to cluster attractors 4 and 5 together as a degenerate attractor to make
they collectively represent the two lone pairs, we can input
-6 // Set parameter for attractor clustering or manually perform clustering
3 // Cluster specified attractors
4,5 // Attractors 4 and 5 will be clustered as a single one

0 // Return
Select option 0 to open GUI, as shown below, you can find that the index of all attractors have
changed, and the two attractors corresponding to the oxygen lone pairs now sharing the same index,
namely 4.

Integrating basins
Close the GUI by clicking "RETURN" button, choose option 2 and then select 1 to integrate
electron density in the ESP basins, the result is
#Basin

Sum of above values:

Integral of the grids travelled to box boundary:

0.00000007

Since currently basin 4 is just the whole negative ESP region, the result shows that in average
there are 0.682 electrons in the negative ESP region. Indeed this value is not large (one may expects
that there should be about four electrons due to the two lone pairs), this is because ESP of most
regions of the molecular space is dominated by nuclear charges and hence positive.
Simultaneously showing ESP minimum points and isosurfaces
In J. Comput. Chem., 39, 488 (2018), the authors showed that by plotting ESP minimum points
and isosurfaces in the same map, the region of lone pairs can be very clearly exhibited. The isovalue
is chosen to be higher than global minimum value of ESP by 10 kcal/mol. Here we plot this kind
map.
Recall that when we just finished the basin generation, the value of each ESP minimum is
printed on screen (you can also choose option " -3 Show information of attractors" any time to show
them again):

be set to -0.09222+10/627.51 = -0.07628 a.u.

to save image file to current folder, you will see below effect (the value is manually labelled)

Perform basin analysis using external cube file
Multiwfn is able to perform basin analysis solely based on grid data, thus the real space
function to be analyzed could not be any one that formally supported by Multiwfn, such as the
Anisotropy of the Induced Current Density (Chem. Rev., 105, 3758 (2005)), which can be calculated
by AICD or GIMIC codes. In order to illustrate this important feature, now we redo some analyses
shown above but using the grid data directly generated by the cubegen utility in Gaussian.
Run below commands in console window of your system to produce density.cub and ESP.cub.
cubegen 0 fdensity H2O.fch density.cub 0 h
cubegen 0 potential H2O.fch ESP.cub 0 h

Then boot up Multiwfn and input
ESP.cub // This file contains ESP grid data. After loading it, the grid data will be stored in
memory
17 // Basin analysis
1 // Select real space function used to partitioning basins
2 // Generate the basins by using the grid data stored in memory
Now visualize located attractors in option 0:

Exit GUI, then input following commands
2 // Integrate real space functions in the basins

density.cub // This file contains electron density grid data
The result is very close to the one we obtained in Part 1 of present section. For example, the
electron population number in negative ESP region we get here is 0.339*2=0.678, while the
counterpart value we obtained earlier is 0.682.
At last, we select option 3 to calculate electric multipole moments for the basins. Because cube
file does not contain GTF (Gaussian type function) information, you will be prompted to input the
path of a file containing GTF information of present system, so that electric multipole moments can
be calculated. We input the path of the H2O.fch file, and then input -1, the electric multipole
moments of all basins will be immediately outputted on screen.

4.17.4 Basin analysis of electron density difference for H2O
In this example we analyze basins of electron density difference for H2O to quantitatively study
the electron density deformation during formation of the molecule.
Before doing the basin analysis, we need to generate grid data of electron density difference
first by main function 5, wavefunction file of all related elements must be available. Here we directly
use the set of atomic wavefunction files provided in Multiwfn package, namely copying "atomwfn"
subfolder in "example" folder to current folder, then during generating grid data of electron density
difference Multiwfn will automatically use them. There are several different ways to prepare atomic
wavefunction files, please recall Section 4.4.7 and consult Section 3.7.3.
After that, boot up Multiwfn and input:
examples\H2O.fch // Generated at B3LYP/6-31G** level
5 // Calculate grid data
-2 // Obtain deformation property
1 // Electron density
3 // High quality grid. Because the variation of electron density difference is complicated,
using relatively high quality of grid is compulsory. Note that the "high quality grid" we selected
here only defines the total number of grids, and hence has different meaning to the one involved in
function 1 of basin analysis module
0 // After the calculation is finished, return to main menu
17 // Basin analysis module
1 // Generate basins and locate attractors
2 // Generate the basins by using the grid data stored in memory (namely the grid data we just
calculated by main function 5)
Enter function 0 to visualize the result, you will see the left graph shown below. After deselect
"Show molecule", the graph will look like the right one

Positive (negative) part of electron density difference corresponds to the region where electron
density increases (decreases) after formation of the molecule. Light green spheres denote the
maxima of the positive part, while light blue ones denote the minima of the negative part.
If you feel difficult to imagine why the maxima and minima distribute like this, I suggest you
to plot plane maps for electron density difference. The left graph shown below is the electron density
difference map vertical to the molecular plane, while the right graph is the map in the molecular
plane.

By comparing the attractors with plane maps, it is evident that attractor 4 and 5 are the maxima
in the region where electron density is enhanced due to the formation of the O-H bonds. While the
presence of attractor 6 arises from the electron aggregation due to formation of the lone pairs.
Note 1: Attractor 6 is two-fold degenerate, namely as you can see, it corresponds to two attractors. This is
because the two attractors share the same value and they are very closely placed with each other.
Note 2: Attractor 8 does not have its counterpart in another side of symmetry plane. The reason of this problem
is that the grid quality employed is not high enough relative to the complicated characteristic of electron density
difference.

It is interesting to examine how many electrons are aggregated between C and H due to the
bond formation. There can be many ways to measure this quantity; the most reasonable one for
present case is to integrate the electron density difference in basin 4 or in basin 5. Let us do this now.
Choose function 2, and then select option 0 to take the grid data of electron density difference as
integrand. From the output we can find that the integral is 0.102 e.
If you would like to compare the attractors with the isosurface of electron density difference,
you can simply choose option -10 to return to main menu of Multiwfn, and then choose suboption

4.17.5 Study source function in AIM basins
Source function has been briefed in part 19 of Section 2.6. Commonly, bond critical point (BCP)
is taken as the reference point of source function when bonding problem is discussed. In this
example we calculate source function in AIM basins for ethane; in particular, based on source
function we will get the contribution from methyl group to the electron density at the BCP of its CH bond. Before calculating source function we should perform topology analysis first to find out
the position of the BCP.
Boot up Multiwfn and input:
examples\ethane.wfn // Optimized and produced at B3LYP/6-31G*
2 // Topology analysis
2 // Search nuclear critical points
3 // Search BCPs
0 // Visualize result, see below

Critical point 11 will be selected as the reference point of the source function. Of course,
selecting which BCP is completely arbitrary. Now close the GUI of topology analysis module
You'd better choose option 7 and then input 11 to check the electron density at this CP, because

763

--- page break ---

4 Tutorials and Examples
theoretically the integral of source function in the whole space should equal to the electron density
at its reference point, therefore this value is important to examine if the integration of source
function is accurate enough. The electron density at CP11 is 0.276277.
From the information shown in the command-line window you can find the coordinate of CP11
is (0.0,-1.199262548,-1.909104063), copy it from the window to clipboard (if you do not know how
to do this please consult Section 5.4). Next, we will set CP11 as the reference point of the source
function. Although you can define reference point by "refxyz" parameters in settings.ini, there is a
trick can do the same thing, by which you needn't to close Multiwfn and then reboot it to make the
parameters take effect!
Input below commands
-10 // Return to main menu from topology analysis module
1000 // A hidden interface
1 // Set reference point
Paste the coordinate of CP11 to the window and then press ENTER button.
17 // Basin analysis
1 // Generate basins and locate attractors
1 // Electron density
2 // Medium quality grid
Enter GUI by choosing function 0, you will see

Now we integrate source function in the AIM basins. Input following commands

4.17.6 Local region basin analysis for polyyne
Sometimes, the geometry of the system we studied is rather extended, for instance, polyyne
C14H2, which can be formally illustrated as
H1−C2≡C3−C4≡C5−C6≡C7−C8≡C9−C10≡C11−C12≡C13−C14≡C15−H16
If we are only interested in the electronic structure characteristic of local region in this system, by
properly setting up grid, basin analysis can be conducted only for the interesting region rather than
for the whole system to save computational time. As an example, in this section we will try to acquire
electron population number in the ELF basin of V(C7,C8) and V(C8,C9) with minimum
computational cost.
Boot up Multiwfn and input following commands:
examples\polyyne.wfn // Optimized and produced under B3LYP/6-31G*
17 // Basin analysis
1 // Generate basins and locate attractors
9 // ELF
8 // Set the grid by inputting center coordinate, grid spacing and box length
a8 // Take the position of atom 8 as box center
0.08 // Grid spacing (Bohr)
10,10,8 // Box length in X, Y and Z directions (Bohr). Note that current molecule
is aligned in Z-axis. Obviously, the larger the box, the longer the computational time
must be spent. While the box should not be too small, otherwise the basins of interest
may be truncated. Choosing appropriate box size highly relies on users' experience
After the calculation is finished, enter GUI by selecting option 0, you will see the
graph shown at the right side. Clearly, only several attractors near C8 are located. Basin
5 and basin 21 correspond to V(C7,C8) and V(C8,C9), respectively. Notice that although
attractor 1 and 6 are also located, due to their corresponding basins are not only large but
also close to box boundary, it can be expected basin 1 and 6 are severely truncated and
hence studying them are meaningless.
When you use above manner to study local region, you will always find there are
many grids travelled to box boundary. In present example, as shown in command-line
window, the number of such type of grids is 60668. You can visualize them by choosing
"Boun" in basin list of GUI, see the graph below

Now close GUI, select option 2 and then select 1, the result shows that the integral of electron
density in V(C7,C8) and V(C8,C9) are 2.78 and 5.02, respectively. Evidently, the bonding between
C8-C9 is much stronger than C7-C8, this is why the bond length of the former (1.236Ǻ) is shorter
than the latter (1.338Ǻ). Note that the electron population number in V(C,C) of acetylene is 5.37
(see Section 4.17.2), therefore it can be expected that C8-C9 is weaker than typical C-C triple bond,
mostly due to the electron global conjugation in polyyne.
The interested users can redo the basin analysis for the whole system with using the same grid
spacing (0.08 Bohr), the computational amount will be much larger than current example. For
V(C7,C8) and V(C8,C9), you will find the result does not differ from the one we obtained above
detectably.

4.17.7 Evaluate atomic contribution to population of ELF basins
In this section, I will use CH3NH2 as example to show how to obtain contribution of C and N
to population of V(C,N) ELF bond basin based on AIM partition of atomic space, this is useful to
examine bond polarity. You can also use the similar way to obtain atomic contribution to population
of any other kind of basins (e.g. LOL basin, ESP basin).
First, we need to generate a cube file named basin.cub, whose grid value corresponds to index
of ELF basins. Boot up Multiwfn and input
examples\CH3NH2.wfn
17 // Basin analysis
1 // Generate basins and locate attractors
9 // ELF
2 // Medium quality grid
Now enter option 0 to examine the basin index

Evidently basin 5 corresponds to V(N,C), which is the one we will study. Then close the GUI
and input
-5 // Export basin as cube file
a // Export basin.cub in current folder
Next, we generate AIM basins as usual, the grid setting must be exactly identical to basin.cub
1 // Regenerate basins
1 // Select real space function
1 // Electron density
9 // Use grid setting of another cube file, this is the safest way to ensure the grid data to be
generated has the same grid setting as basin.cub
basin.cub
0 // Check attractors

It is clear that the attractor index corresponding to N and C are 2 and 3, respectively. Then we
evaluate atomic contribution to population of the basins defined in basin.cub
9 // Then program loads basin.cub in current folder
2 // The index of the attractor corresponding to N
5 // The 5th ELF basin, i.e. V(N,C) basin
The result is 1.15866, namely N contributes 1.159 electrons to V(N,C) basin. Then input
3 // The index of the attractor corresponding to C
5 // The 5th ELF basin, i.e. V(N,C) basin
From the result we know that C contributes 0.463 electrons to the V(N,C) basin.
Since N contributes much more electrons than C to their ELF bond basin, it may thus be
concluded that C-N is a bond with significant polarity.

4.17.8 Calculating high ELF localization domain population and
volume (HELP, HELV)
The high ELF localization domain population and volume (HELP and HELV, respectively)
were proposed in ChemPhysChem, 14, 3714 (2013), it was shown that they are useful quantities in

characterizing lone pair electron and they have close relationship with molecular properties that
related to lone pairs, such as ionization potential and energy of frontier molecular orbitals, see the
ChemPhysChem paper for detail. The definitions of HELP and HELV are clearly illustrated in below
map, PH3 is taken as an instance.

From above map it can be seen that this method defines a region named high ELF localization
domain (HEL), which simultaneously satisfies three conditions:
(1) Electron density is larger than 0.001 a.u.
(2) Electron localization function (ELF) is larger than 0.5
(3) Every point belongs to the ELF basin corresponding to a lone pair
The volume and electron population of the HEL are denoted as HELV and HELP, respectively.
It is believed that this definition is better than (3) for representing lone pair area, because
insignificant region (i.e. outside vdW surface, which corresponds to  = 0.001 a.u.) and the region
without clear chemical meaning (i.e. ELF < 0.5) are excluded.
Now we use Multiwfn to calculate HELV and HELP for PH3. Boot up Multiwfn and input
examples\PH3.wfn // Generated at M06-2X/def2-TZVPP level, optimized at the same level
17 // Basin analysis
1 // Generate basins and locate attractors
9 // ELF must be chosen to define basins if you intend to calculate HELP and HELV
2 // Medium quality grid
Now we select option 0 to check attractor indices:

From above map, we can find attractor 5 corresponds to lone pair of the P atom.

Next, we input
10 // Calculate HELP and HELV
0 // Select basins and calculate their HELP and HELV
5 // The basin index corresponding the lone pair of the P atom
After a while, you will see:
Basin information: (constraints are not taken into account)
Population:

2.0719

Volume: 1561.1570 Bohr^3

High ELF localization domain population (HELP):

1.4858

High ELF localization domain volume (HELV):

80.5500 Bohr^3

As can be seen, HELP and HELV are 1.4858 and 80.55 Bohr3, respectively, which are very
close to the values in the original paper, namely 1.50 and 80 Bohr3. The marginal difference comes
from the fact that the calculation level we employed is not identical to the original paper, in addition,
the detail of numerical setting in our calculation must be somewhat different to the original paper.
From above output you can also find the population and volume of the ELF basin, which can
also be calculated via option 2 of basin analysis module.

4.17.9 Evaluate atomic contributions to system electronic energy
Background knowledge
Electronic energy of the whole system can be viewed as sum of electronic energies of all atoms,
which correspond to integral of electronic energy density E(r) in atomic basins. This decomposition
of system energy is very helpful of providing deep insight into status of atoms in different chemical
environments, and important in revealing major factors that influences relative energy between
different configurations or conformations. See Russ. Chem. Rev., 78, 283 (2009) for extensive
discussions and application examples.
There is a relationship E(r) = -K(r), where K(r) is Hamiltonian kinetic energy. The integral of
E(r) and K(r) in atomic basin  will be referred to as E and T, respectively, and it is clear that E
= -T. Sum of all E and T are denoted as E and T, which correspond to electronic energy and
electronic kinetic energy of the whole system, respectively. However, the E obtained in this way in
fact differs from the electronic energy reported by quantum chemistry program (EQC), because in
practice virial ratio is always more or less violated, and if KS-DFT method is used, the T is only the
kinetic energy corresponding to non-interaction particle model, while its correction for dependent
particles is absorbed into the exchange-correlation functional. Therefore the actual E should be
finally scaled as follows so that sum of all E just equals to EQC:

E =

EQC
 T
T

It is important to note that pseudopotential should not be employed, because it makes virial
theorem severely violated. In addition, the geometry should be sufficiently optimized to diminish
deviation to virial theorem.
Example
In this example, we calculate atomic energies of H2CO. Boot up Multiwfn and input

The electronic energy yielded by quantum chemistry calculation can be manually found at the
end of the H2CO.wfn, namely -114.50047 a.u., which is also printed by Multiwfn after loading this
file. Note that the T is 113.47305 a.u., hence the atomic energy of O3 can be calculated as
75.30252*-114.50047/113.47305 = -75.98433 a.u., similarly for other atoms. You can also then
manually sum up atomic energy for some atoms to derive fragment energy.
It is noteworthy that the actual virial ratio of H2CO.wfn is 2.009, which can be found at the
end of this file and also printed after Multiwfn loading this file. Since its deviation to exact virial
ratio 2.0 is insignificant, our scaling treatment of E is reasonable and acceptable.
An evidently more convenient and better way of deriving atomic contribution to energy is
choosing user-defined function -11 as the integrand, it is scaled electron energy density involving
virial ratio, whose integral over the whole space exactly equals to the electronic energy given by
quantum chemistry code, see corresponding part of Section 2.7 for its definition. Now we redo the
above example. Open settings.ini and set “iuserfunc” to -11, then boot up Multiwfn and input
examples\H2CO.wfn

It can be seen that the integral -114.50044630 a.u. is basically exactly equal to the electronic energy
of -114.50047 a.u. that recorded in the .wfn file. The contribution of O3 to total electronic energy is

4.17.10 Plotting ELF isosurface map colored by basin types
Many papers studied ELF by plotting its isosurface map and colored the isosurfaces according
to basin type (monosynaptic, disynaptic, and others). In Section 4.5.1 I have already mentioned it is
possible to use ChimeraX software to easily plot such a map based on .cub file exported by Multiwfn,
however there are some limitations, namely the coloring will change when isovalue is changed, and
a whole isosurface cannot be colored differently in the subregions corresponding to different type
of basins. In this section, I will show how to use basin analysis module of Multiwfn in combination
with VMD (freely available at http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/) to plot the basin type colored
ELF isosurface map without these limitations. A simple molecule oxirane will be taken as example,
its wavefunction file is examples\oxirane.fchk. The version of VMD I am using is 1.9.3.
Boot up Multiwfn and input
examples\oxirane.fchk
17 // Basin analysis
1 // Generate basins
9 // ELF
2 // Medium quality grid
Now you can choose option 0 to visualize the located attractors:

By comparing the automatically assigned basin labels and the graph in GUI window, you can
confirm that the basins are indeed correctly labelled.
Then input
-5 // Export basins as cube file
b // A special mode designed for plotting basin type colored ELF isosurfaces in VMD
10,11 // Indices of the monosynaptic basins, corresponding to the highlighted text above
1-5,8,9 // Indices of the disynaptic basins, corresponding to the highlighted text above
Now basinsyn.cub and basinfunc.cub are exported in current folder. In basinsyn.cub, the values
within the monosynaptic and disynaptic basins regions are -1 and 1, respectively, while all other
regions have value of 0. The basinfunc.cub records the real space function used to generate basins,
namely ELF in the present context.
Move the basinsyn.cub and basinfunc.cub as well as plotting script
examples\scripts\basinsyn.vmd to VMD folder. Then boot up VMD, input source basinsyn.vmd to
execute the script, you will see the following figure. The default isosurface is 0.8, and the regions
corresponding to monosynaptic and disynaptic basins are colored by green and red, respectively,
while other basins (corresponding to core basins in this example) are colored by white.

You can change isovalue by entering “Graphics” - “Representation” and input expected value
in “Isovalue” textbox. In this panel you can also adjust the material of isosurface. If you want to
change the color for different types of basins, enter “Graphics” - “Colors” - “Color Scale” and
change corresponding options.
The above illustrated plotting method is never limited to ELF, you can similarly employ it to
others, such as LOL, IRI, etc.
Next, assume that we want to color the V(C,H) basins in the above graph by yellow, how to do
