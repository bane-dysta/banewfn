that? You just need to ask Multiwfn to export grid data of function value for corresponding basins,
draw them as isosurface and then directly specify the color. Let us do this, input the following
commands
-5 // Export basins as cube file
c // Export grid data of function value in the region of specific basins as basinsel.cub file in
current folder
1,2,4,5 // Indices of the four V(C,H) basins
0 // In the exported .cub file, if a grid does not belong to the selected basins, its value will be
the value you specified here
Now basinsel.cub has been generated in current folder. Load it into VMD, select “Graphics” “Representation”, set “Drawing Method” to “Isosurface”, change “Coloring Method” to “Color ID”
and choose “4 yellow”. Then change “Isovalue” to a value marginally smaller than the existing
isosurfaces to guarantee to overlay them (for example 0.795 in this case, which is marginally than
the 0.8 set by the basinsyn.vmd), now you can see the following graph, which is quite satisfactory!

4.18 Electron excitation analysis
Main function 18 of Multiwfn is very powerful, it is a collection of electron excitation analysis
methods and able to provide very deep insight into all aspects of electron transition characters. In
this section I will illustrate most of them using practical instances. Before following below examples,
please at least first read beginning of Section 3.21 to understand requirement on the input files.
Although I illustrate all analyses based on Gaussian output files, these functions are by no means
limited to Gaussian users!

4.18.1 Using hole-electron analysis to fully characterize electron
excitations
The hole-electron analysis module of Multiwfn is quite powerful, it is able to present very
comprehensive characterization for all kinds of electron excitations. If you are not familiar with
basic theories and ideas of hole-electron analysis, please read Section 3.21.1. The requirement on

input file for the hole-electron analysis has been described at the beginning of Section 3.21, please
carefully check it. Below I will employ two systems to illustrate the use of the hole-electron analysis,
the first one is a typical donor--acceptor system, the second one is a typical coordinate. The
Chinese version of this section is my blog article "Using Multiwfn to perform hole-electron analysis
to fully investigate electronic excitation character" (http://sobereva.com/434), in which there is an
additional example, namely studying Rydberg excitation of H2CO.
If hole-electron is employed in your work, please not only cite Multiwfn original paper but
also cite my work: Carbon, 165, 461 (2020) DOI: 10.1016/j.carbon.2020.05.023, in which holeelectron analysis is briefly described in supplemental information.

4.18.1.1 Example 1: NH2-biphenyl-NO2
The example in this section is quite long, please carefully and patiently read it. In this section
I will take the NH2-biphenyl-NO2 as example, its geometry is shown below.

In this system the biphenyl moiety behaves as a -linker, and it is well-known that the nitro
group and amino group act as electron acceptor and donor during electron excitation, respectively,
therefore it is expected that there must be some charge-transfer (CT) states corresponding to overall
electron displacement from the amino group side to the nitro group side.
Preparation
Here I assume that you are a Gaussian user (other quantum chemistry codes users can also
utilize the hole-electron analysis). We optimize the geometry at the B3LYP/6-31G* level, then carry
out TDDFT calculation using below settings (the input file has been provided as examples\excit\Dpi-A.gjf), then five lowest singlet excited states will be evaluated. Note that IOp(9/40=4) must be
specified, the reason has been clearly mentioned at the beginning of Section 3.21. The CAM-B3LYP
is employed here because it is able to faithfully represent CT excitations.
%chk=D-pi-A.chk
# CAM-B3LYP/6-31g(d) TD(nstates=5) IOp(9/40=4)
After calculation, convert the .chk file to .fch/fchk file, the resulting .fchk file has been
provided as examples\excit\D-pi-A.fchk. The output file of this task has been provided as
examples\excit\D-pi-A.out.
Examining quantitative indices defined in the hole-electron analysis framework
Boot up Multiwfn and input below command
examples\excit\D-pi-A.fchk

1 // Hole-electron analysis
examples\excit\D-pi-A.out // In fact you can also press ENTER button directly, because the
name of the .out file is identical to the .fchk file and they are in the same folder

1 // Study excitation between ground state (S0) and the first excited state (S1)
1 // Calculate distribution of hole, electron and so on as well as various indices
2 // Medium quality grid (this is suited for small and medium sized systems. For large systems,
you should use at least "high quality grid", or manually input a proper grid spacing)
Once calculation is finished, you will find below information on screen. The data (except for
the excitation energy) are calculated by grid-based integration. Clearly, for the same system, the
higher number of grids, the better accuracy of the data.

In the output, the "Integral of hole" and "Integral of electron" are the integrals of hole and
electron over the whole space, respectively, they should be exactly 1.0 in principle. However, due
to the unavoidable numerical integration error, the calculated values have slight deviation to 1.0.
Since the deviation is extremely small, we can say that for the current excited state of the current
system, the grid setting we employed is fully adequate.
Note: If you find the integral of hole or electron deviates from 1.0 evidently, then the outputted indexes may be
unreliable. There are three possibilities: (1) You forgot to use IOp(9/40=3 or 4) (2) The grid quality is too low (3)
The extension distance is not large enough, therefore the spatial region of the grid points does not fully cover the
main distribution region of hole or electron (when Rydberg excitation is investigated, the default extension distance
should always be enlarged).

The rest terms in the above output in turn are: The integral of transition density over the whole
space (ideal value is 0), transition electric dipole moment, Sm and Sr indices, centroid coordinate of
hole and electron, D and D indices, X/Y/Z components and norm of variation of excited state dipole
moment with respect to the ground state one, RMSD () of hole and electron, Δ and Δ indices,
Hλ/HCT/H indices, t index, hole and electron delocalization index, Ghost-hunter index, excitation
energy (which is loaded from Gaussian output file directly).
Note that the "Ghost-hunter index" in above output is slightly different to the definition in its original paper,
the implementation in Multiwfn must be more reasonable, see Section 3.21.7 for detail. The 1st term denotes the
part depending on configuration coefficients and MO energies, while the 2nd term corresponds to 1/D. The ghost-

hunter index is just the difference of the two terms.
The transition dipole moment outputted above is obtained by integrating evenly distributed grids of transition
dipole moment density. It can also be directly read from the Gaussian output file, the X/Y/Z components are 0.4427,
-0.0005, -0.0012 a.u., which are very close to the ones output by Multiwfn, namely 0.444063, -0.000186, -0.001753.
This observation further reflects that the grid setting we employed is appropriate.

For the S0→S1 excitation under current study, from the above output, it can be seen that the D
index is merely 0.522 Å, which is obviously a very small value since it is even less than half length
of a typical C-C bond. The Sr index reaches 0.519 (the theoretical upper limit is 1.0), which is a
large value, implying that about half part of hole and electron has perfectly matched. So, by simply
examining Sr and D indices, we are already able to conclude that this excitation should be a typical
local excitation (LE). Then let us look at the t index, its total value is -0.998, which is much less
than 0, meaning that there is no significant separation of hole and electron distributions, further
implying that this excitation should be attributed to LE type.
Visual study of various real space functions in the hole-electron framework
Now you should see the post-processing menu on the screen. The meaning of each option is
self-explanatory. Please read through each option carefully. Here we choose option 3, we will see
distribution of hole and electron at the same time:

In above figures, green represents the electron distribution, and blue represents the hole distribution,
isovalue has been set to 0.005. Both the hole and electron appear almost exclusively in the nitro
group, so there is no doubt that S0→S1 is a LE excitation, well verifying our conclusion based on
the D, Sr, and t indices. In addition, according to the above hole distribution map, the hole appears
to be composed of lone pair orbitals of oxygens since there is one lobe on each side of each oxygen.
Electron distribution has a nodal plane along the nitro group, therefore we can infer that the electron
distribution should be composed of * orbital. Now we can draw the conclusion that that S0→S1 is
a LE excitation with n→* feature.
Then close the graphical window and select option 8 to visualize Chole and Cele, which are
transformed from hole and electron distributions respectively to make their distribution behavior
smoother. The isosurface map is show below (In order to see clearly, transparent style is used).

As can be seen, the graph of Chole and Cele look obviously more intuitive, they are very sleek and do
not have any nodal character as hole and electron. Therefore using Chole/Cele map to replace the
hole/electron map is a good choice in many cases. (BTW: If isosurfaces of Chole and Cele are not

776

visible in the GUI window, that means the current isovalue is too large, you should gradually and
carefully decrease it until the isosurfaces are visible)
Next, let us take a look at the overlap function of hole and electron, namely the Sr function.
Close current graphical window, select option 4 in the post-processing menu, and then select option
2 to display the Sr function, you will see below map (isovalue is set to 0.005)

From the graph one can clearly find where the hole and electron overlap significantly. As can be
seen, around each oxygen there are four regions where the hole and electron are highly overlapped.
It is easy to understand why the Sr graph looks like this by comparing the hole and electron
isosurfaces shown earlier.
Then close the window and select option 7, charge density difference (CDD) between the
excited state and the ground state will be shown, see below. In this map, the isovalue is set to 0.005,
green and blue correspond to increase and decrease of the excited state density with respect to the
ground state density, respectively.

The CDD map and the map simultaneously showing hole and electron distributions (referred
to as "hole&electron map" later) are similar, but there are also differences. The key difference is that
in the CDD map, the hole and electron have been largely cancelled in their overlapping region; in
contrast, in the hole&electron map, the overlapping between hole and electron can be faithfully
exhibited. I think the hole&electron map is more useful than the CDD map to investigate the
intrinsic characteristics of electron excitation because it directly exhibits the pristine distribution of
hole and electron.
By the way, if we select option 18 in the post-processing menu, the program will start to
calculate the Coulomb attractive energy (also known as exciton binding energy) between the hole
and electron. The calculation is quite time-consuming even for medium sized system, so please wait
patiently. The final output is:
Coulomb attractive energy:

0.287031 a.u.

(

7.810524 eV )

Important note: By using VMD software, you can plot above mentioned functions in much
better quality with only a few steps. I strongly suggest you check the example given in Section
4.A.14 on how to do this.
Examining quantitative contributions to hole and electron
Next, I demonstrate how to evaluate contribution of MOs to hole and electron. After selecting

option 0 in the post-processing menu to return to the hole-electron analysis interface, we select
subfunction 2 and input an outputting threshold. Here we input 1, then MOs with contribution to
hole or electron higher than 1% will be shown on screen:

Sum of electron:

100.001 %

It can be seen from the data that MO52 is absolutely dominant for hole, it contributes as high as
96.2%, while electron is mainly composed of MO57, with a contribution of 85.4%. This observation
implies that if one discusses electron excitation solely based MO52 and MO57, although in this case
the electron excitation can be qualitatively described, there are still non-negligible deviations. The
"Sum of hole" and "Sum of electron" shown above are the sum of the contributions of all orbitals to
hole and electron, respectively (including the terms not outputted), these two values in principle
should be exactly 100%, but currently there are 0.001% error. Such a small error can be completely
ignored, it comes from the fact that not all configuration coefficients are printed by Gaussian (only
configuration coefficients greater than 0.0001 are requested to be outputted during Gaussian
calculation via IOp(9/40=4))
Then we check contribution of atoms or fragments to hole and electron. Select subfunction 3
in hole-electron analysis interface, then choose Mulliken-like partition, you will see

Since hydrogen atoms generally do not participate in electron excitation of chemical interest,
only the information of non-hydrogen atoms is outputted, including the atomic contributions to hole,
electron, hole-electron overlap, electron-hole difference (i.e. CDD). The indices of the atoms in the
nitro group are 21, 22, and 23, it can be seen from the data that the two oxygens of the nitro group
contribute most to the hole, the sum of their contributions is 246.192%. The spatial delocalization

778

of the electron is relatively stronger, the three atoms in the nitro group contribute a total of
224.4+33.983%, the rest part of electron is basically contributed by the atoms in the biphenyl
moiety.
Although the distribution characteristics of hole and electron can be examined by visualizing
isosurface map of hole and electron, the observed isosurfaces are obviously dependent on the choice
of isovalue. So, it is impossible to fully display the hole and electron distribution in all regions by
only one image. On the contrary, the quantitative atomic contributions given above are very
definitive.
The sum of "Diff." of N21, O22 and O23 is about -12%, which shows that the integral value
of the density difference (CDD) in the nitro group is -0.12, revealing that the nitro moiety lost 0.12
electrons during electron excitation, and some of them transferred to the biphenyl moiety (if you
want to investigate charge transfer amount between specific fragments, it is recommended to use
the IFCT method, as illustrated in Section 4.18.8).
Showing atomic contributions to hole and electron in terms of heat map
We can also plot the atomic contributions as heat map, so that the major character can be
immediately and easily captured. Select "4 Set interval between labels in X axis" in current menu
and then input 1 to change the step of abscissa to 1, and then select "1 Plot hole/electron composition
as heat map", you will see below map immediately

In the figure, the numbers in the abscissa are indices of non-hydrogen atoms. This figure
describes the contribution of each non-hydrogen atom to hole, electron and their overlap by color
(e.g. 0.4 corresponds to 40%). For example, based on the list of contributions of non-hydrogen
atoms to hole/electron that shown earlier, we can know that the position 16 in the abscissa of the
figure actually corresponds to atom N24. In order to more conveniently find the correspondence
between the indices in the abscissa and actual atomic indices, you can open
corresponding .fch/.gjf/.out file by GaussView, Select "Edit" - "Atom List", then select "Edit" "Reorder" - "All atoms: Hydrogens Last", then you will see below graph in GaussView, in which
indices of all hydrogen atoms have been placed behind indices of non-hydrogen atoms. Clearly, in
this case the atomic indices in the molecular structure directly corresponds to the indices in the
abscissa of the heat map.

From indices in the above map, we find that the position of 13, 14 and 15 in the heat map

779

4 Tutorials and Examples
correspond to the two oxygens and one nitrogen atoms in the nitro group, the position 16
corresponds to the nitrogen in amino group, the rest are carbons in the biphenyl moiety. In the heat
map, the row corresponding to hole clearly revealed that the hole is almost solely contributed by the
two oxygens in the nitro group, since corresponding matrix elements are red (large value). Electron
is also mainly contributed by the nitro group, but other molecule regions also have non-negligible
contributions, this is why in the row corresponding to electron, blue color appears in the matrix
elements other than positions 13~15. The information conveyed by colors of the row corresponding
to overlap is that there is significant overlap between hole and electron on the oxygens of the nitro
groups, while the overlap in other areas of the systems is far from being so remarkable.
There are many options in the hole/electron composition analysis interface, they can be used
to adjust plotting effect of the heat map, save the heat map as an image file, switch whether to
include the hydrogen atoms into the heat map, and export the data to he_atm.txt in current folder so
that you can draw the heat map yourself in other programs such as Origin. These options will not
be explained one by one here, please try it yourself.
Investigating fragment contributions to hole and electron
The option "-1 Load fragment definition" in the above hole/electron composition analysis
interface is important, it is used to load fragment definition, then fragment contribution to hole and
electron will be shown, and fragment-based heat map could be drawn, which makes the discussion
significantly more convenient. Here we divide the system into four fragments in the following way.

Select option "-1 Load fragment definition", and then input
4 // Define four fragments
21-23 // The atomic indices of fragment 1 (the nitro group)
11-20 // The atomic indices of fragment 2 (the benzene neighbouring to nitro group)
1-10 // The atomic indices of fragment 3 (the benzene neighbouring to amino group)
24-26 // The atomic indices of fragment 4 (the amino group)
You will see below output immediately
Contribution of each fragment to hole and electron:

Hole: 94.68 %

The data shows that 94.68% of hole is located on the nitro group, while 82.67% and 15.67%
of electron are located on the nitro group and neighbouring benzene ring, respectively. The degree
of overlap between hole and electron on the nitro group is about 90%. Since "Diff." of the nitro
group is -12.01%, and the excitation under current investigation is a single electron excitation,
therefore, it can be said that the electron on the nitro group is reduced by 0.1201 during the electron

excitation process, while the benzene ring neighbouring to the nitro group gained 0.1247 electrons.
Then, if you want to make representation of the above data more intuitive, we can select option 1 to
draw the fragment-based heat map. The abscissa at this time corresponds to fragment index, as
shown below:

It can be seen from the figure that the spatial distribution range of electron is larger than hole.
Collective comparison of all electron excitations
At this point, various analyses in the hole-electron framework for the S0→S1 excitation of the
NH2-biphenyl-NO2 system have been completely completed. If you also want to analyze other
excited states, you should return to the menu of main function 18 by option 0, enter the hole-electron
analysis function again, and then select the corresponding excited state. Here we put together the D,
Sr, H, t index and hole-electron Coulomb attraction energy of all the five excited states calculated
in this system. The hole delocalization index (HDI) and electron delocalization index (EDI), which

Below are hole&electron map, Chole&Cele map and Sr function map of all the five excitations.
The isovalues are set to 0.003. It can be seen that the Chole&Cele map can always display the main
distribution features of the hole&electron map in a clearer and more intuitive way. However, many
details are lost during the transformation; for example it is impossible to determine the specific type
of the electron excitation (such as n-*, -*) solely based on the Chole&Cele map.

Now we look at the indices together with the isosurface graphs. For the D index, only the
S0→S2 value has very large (3.48 Å), so it can obviously be considered as CT excitation. Indeed,
from above graph it can be seen that the distance between the center of the blue and green isosurfaces
(namely centroids of Chole and Cele) is large. While for other excitations, the centers of the blue and
green isosurfaces are close together, therefore they should be regarded as LE excitations.
Then we examine the Sr index. We find that the Sr indices of all excited states are relatively
large. In particular, the values of the S0→S4 and S0→S5 are rather large, up to 0.87, the main reason
is that these two excitations are highly localized -* type of excitation on the benzene ring. It is
worth to mention that although S0→S1 is also a highly localized excitation, its Sr (0.52) is even
smaller than the Sr (0.65) of S0→S2, which is a CT excitation. The reason why the Sr index of the
S0→S1 is not as large as expectation is not difficult to understand. As mentioned earlier, S0→S1
shows n→* feature, the main body of lone pair is on the NO2 plane, while * orbital has a nodal
plane on the NO2 plane, hence the overlap of hole and electron should be limited.
Next, look at the H index, which reflects the breadth of the average distribution of hole and
electron. It can be seen from the hole&electron map that both the hole and electron of S0→S1 and
S0→S3 are distributed in a local region, this is why their H indices are not large. Since the
distribution of hole and electron corresponding to the excitations from S0 to S2, S4 and S5 are
evidently wider than S0→S1, their H indices are evidently larger.
One can see that only the t index of S0→S2 is a slightly positive value, indicating that the
separation of hole and electron is obvious, so it is more reasonable to consider S0→S2 as a CT
excitation. The t indices corresponding to the excitations from S0 to other excited states are evident
negative values, suggesting that degree of separation of their hole and electron is very low.
By comparing the hole and electron isosurface maps, we can find that the HDI and EDI indices
indeed nicely quantified the uniformity of spatial distribution (i.e. degree of delocalization) of hole
and electron, respectively. It can be seen that both hole and electron of S0→S1 and S0→S3 are
highly localized, corresponding to large calculated value of HDI and EDI. In contrast, the hole and
electron distributions of S0→S2/S4/S5 are evidently more delocalized, this point is faithfully
revealed by their relatively small HDI and EDI values.
The hole-electron Coulomb attractive energy given in the table is closely related to the electron
excitation characteristics, and the most influential factor should be the D index. It is easy to
understand that the larger the D index is, the farther the distance between the main distribution

782

regions of hole and electron, and thus the weaker the Coulomb attractive energy. From the data, it
is indeed found that Coulomb attraction energy of S0→S2 (the only CT excitation) is the smallest
one of that of all the five electron excitations. While for the excitations of S0→S1 and S0→S3,
since their D indices are very small and according to the H index the spatial extent of their hole and
electron is very narrow, one can easily imagine that the corresponding Coulomb attraction should
be very strong. Indeed, as can be seen from the previous table, their hole-electron Coulomb
attraction energies are the most negative ones (-7.81 and -8.54 eV).
Combined with the above isosurface maps and quantitative data, we can unambiguously
identify the characteristics of the five excitations:
·S0→S1：LE excitation of n-* type on the nitro group
·S0→S2：CT excitation of -* type from amino group towards nitro group
·S0→S3：The same as S0→S1
·S0→S4：-* LE excitation occurring on the benzene ring attached to the nitro group
·S0→S5：-* LE excitation occurring on the benzene ring attached to the amino group
Here, the heat maps that exhibit contributions to the hole, electron and overlap from all
fragments for all the five excitations are given together. In order to facilitate parallel comparison,
the color scale for all excited states is uniformly set to 0.0~1.0.

From these heat maps, one can immediately make clear where the excited electrons come and where
they go by viewing color of the matrix elements. For example, from the graph of S0→S2, one can
easily recognize that the excited electron is mainly originated from fragment 3 (the benzene attached
to amino group), most of them is transferred to fragment 1 (the nitro group), and a smaller part is
transferred to fragment 2 (the benzene attached to the nitro group). Another example, from the
S0→S4 map one can find that the excited electrons come from fragment 2, after excitation most of
them remain in fragment 2, but a few of them transferred to fragment 1, and the overlap between
hole and electron on fragment 2 is significantly higher than the other regions.

It is worth to note that the detailed characteristics of charge transfer between fragments during
electron excitation can be even better revealed by the IFCT method, see example in Section 4.18.8.
Plotting grid data in VMD
The grid data of hole, electron, Cele, Chole and so on can be exported to cube files by
corresponding options in the post-processing menu, and then you can render them in VMD program
to get better visualization effect. If you do not know how to do, please refer to the description of the
operations in VMD at the end of Section 4.18.3. Furthermore, one can first use VMD to plot
isosurface map for Cele and Chole, and then input such as below command to draw centroids of hole
and electron as purple and orange spheres to make the graph more informative

For the S0→S2 excitation, the graph plotted in above way in VMD is shown below

In order to make understanding easier, an arrow is appended on the graph to highlight the CT

Tip: Obtaining a variety of indices for a range of excited states via script
By Linux shell script, a variety of indices for a range of excited states can be obtained at once.
For example, we want to obtain all indices for excitations of S0→S1,S2,S3, we should copy the the
input files D-pi-A.fchk and D-pi-A.out as well as the all_index.sh from the "examples\excit" folder
to a proper folder, then enter this folder in the Linux terminal, run chmod +x ./batch.sh to add
executable permission, then run ./all_index.sh to execute the script. Each excitation will be analyzed
in turn, the status will be shown on screen until the appearance of "Finished!". Then open the
resulting result.txt file in current folder, you will find

4.18.1.2 Example 2: Ru(bpy3)2+ cation in water
Below we examine several excited states of the Ru(bpy3)2+ cation complex in water by holeelectron analysis based on TDDFT output.

The corresponding Gaussian input file has been provided as examples\excit\Ru(bpy3)2+.gjf,
please calculate it by Gaussian. If you want to directly obtain the resulting output file and .fchk file,
you can download them at http://sobereva.com/multiwfn/extrafiles/Ru_bpy3_2+_TDDFT.zip. As
you can see from the .gjf file, the keywords used are B3LYP/genecp TD(nstates=50) scrf
IOp(9/40=3), where scrf requests Gaussian to employ IEFPCM solvation model to represent water
environment. Since this system is not small, and as many as 50 excited states are evaluated, in order
to avoid too high calculation time in hole-electron analysis and too large Gaussian output file,
IOp(9/40=3) is used instead of the IOp(9/40=4) employed in last section, the analysis accuracy at
this time is still completely sufficient.

All D indices in this table are very small, while all Sr indices are fairly large. The main reason
is that the current molecule is a symmetric system, thus the CT transitions are multiple directional.
The MLCT(%) in the table denotes percent of metal-to-ligand charge transfer character, which can
be easily evaluated in terms of subtracting the percentage of metal in hole (namely hole(Ru%)) by
that in electron (namely ele(Ru%)). Notice that, properly speaking, what we obtained is net MLCT
percentage, it has been somewhat cancelled with LMCT (ligand-to-metal charge transfer).
Below is hole&electron map of S0→S24 excitation with isovalue of 0.002. Since the hole and
electron distributions have a large overlap, for the sake of clarity, the isosurfaces of hole and electron
are given separately.

Combining the graph with the quantitative data in the table, it is clear that the S0→S24
excitation not only has metal-centered (MC) character, namely electrons of the metal are excited
into the metal's own empty orbital, but also have evident MLCT character. As shown in the
hole&electron isosurface map, the main body of both the hole and electron is on the metal, and it
can be seen that the isosurface of electron also has a large portion on the ligand. The calculated
percentage of MLCT feature is 77.3-19.6 = 57.7%, this value should be said to be very consistent
with the information conveyed by the hole-electron isosurface map. Note: The hole also has nonnegligible distribution on the ligand, which is 100%-77.3% = 22.7%. The reason why the hole
isosurface is invisible on the ligands is because its distribution is very diffuse in this region, the hole
on the ligands can only be clearly seen by decreasing the isovalue to a smaller value, such as 0.0005.
Then look at S0→S37 excitation. From the hole&electron isosurface map shown below we can
see that main body of both hole and electron is located at one of the ligands, therefore it is no doubt
that this is a LC (ligand-centered) excitation, corresponding to the case that electrons excited from
ligand to its own * orbitals. Because there is also hole and electron distribution on the metal,
therefore this excitation also shows some MLCT character, which is calculated to be 16.9% - 8.8%
= 8.1%.

Finally, look at the S0→S40 excitation, whose hole and electron isosurfaces are shown at right
part of above map. From the hole isosurface and the percent of hole on metal shown in the previous
table (16.9%), it is found that its hole distribution character is very similar with S0→S24, but the
amount of electron on the ligand is obviously not as large as S0→S24, only tiny part of it is
distributed on the four nitrogens directly coordinating with Ru, so the MLCT feature of S0→S40 is

786

conspicuously weaker than S0→S24. In contrast, its MC characteristic is definitely higher than
S0→S24.
By the way, for coordinate systems, if you want to obtain MLCT, LMCT, LLCT, MC, LC
separately, you should resort to the IFCT analysis illustrated in Section 4.18.8.
We already know that the electron in the excitations from S0 to S24 and S40 mainly sources
from Ru atoms, but how to unveil which are the atomic orbitals that electron excited from? Although
it can be more or less judged from the isosurface map of the hole, there is still some subjectivity. To
figure this out, we can calculate contributions of basis functions to hole and electron. For example,
after entering the hole-electron analysis function and selecting the 40th excited state, we select "4
Show basis function contribution to hole and electron" and then input an outputting threshold, such
as 2, then information of the basis functions contributing to hole or electron higher than 2% will be
printed:

It can be seen from the data that the main contribution to the hole is the D basis function of the
Ru atom. The SDD pseudopotential basis set we currently used only describes 4s, 4p, 4d and 5s
electrons for Ru, so the excited electron of S0→S40 excitation must come from the 4d atomic
orbitals. The basis functions of Ru that have contributions to electron are also D type. Therefore
now we know that the MC component in the S0→S40 corresponds to d-d transition on Ru.
Notice that this is not the only way to determine which orbitals the excited electrons come from and move to,
for example you can also use Multiwfn to perform NTO analysis and examine the pattern of the NTO pair with
largest eigenvalue. However, if the electron excitation under study cannot be well described by any pair of NTOs,
then this approach will not work. In contrast, the hole-electron analysis does not have any limitation.

4.18.2 Illustration of transition density (matrix) and transition dipole
moment density (matrix) analysis
The transition density and transition dipole moment density are very important quantities
involved in electron excitation analysis, they can be studied in the form of real space functions by
hole-electron module, or studied in Hilbert space by plotting as colored matrix maps (also known
as heat maps). The examples in Sections 4.18.2.1, 4.18.2.2 and 4.18.2.3 will illustrate these analyses.
In addition, although the commonly studied transitions are those from ground state to excited states,
the these quantities between two excited states are also useful in some special studies, Section
4.18.2.4 will mention how to realize this.
More discussions about these topics can be found from my blog article: "Using Multiwfn to
plot transition density matrix and charge transfer matrix to investigate electron excitation
characteristics" (in Chinese, http://sobereva.com/436).

4.18.2.1 Analyzing transition density and transition dipole moment density
in real space
Theory of real space function form of transition density, namely T(r), has been introduced as
"Theory 4" in Section 3.21.1.1, isosurface map of T(r) is capable of revealing apparent coherence
region between hole and electron. While the real space function form of transition electric dipole
moment density, namely Tx(r), Ty(r) and Tz(r), are able to exhibit contribution of various regions to
transition electric dipole moment (Dx, Dy, Dz), this point has been introduced as "Theory 5" of
Section 3.21.1.1. In this section, N-phenylpyrrole will be taken as instance to illustrate this kind of
analysis, involved files are completely identical to those utilized in the example in Section 4.18.1.
Boot up Multiwfn and input

representation. If the transition density is multiplied by negative of Z coordinate variable, then we
will obtain Z component of transition dipole moment density, namely Tz(r). To visualize it, we close
current GUI window and choose "6 Show isosurface of transition dipole moment density" and then
select "3: Z component", you will see right graph below

From the above T(r) map, we can see that hole and electron have strong coherence everywhere,
implying that distribution of both hole and electron covers the whole molecule (this can be easily
further confirmed by visualizing hole and electron distributions, as illustrated in Section 4.18.1).
From the right map shown above one can see that its positive (green) part is obviously larger than
negative (blue) part, recall that the integral of Tz(r) over the whole space is just the Z component of
transition electric dipole moment (Dz), this observation explains why Dz of S0→S1 is an large
positive value (1.7813 a.u.). If you have interesting, you can try to plot Tx(r) or Ty(r) maps to
interpret why the electron excitation under study has vanished Dx and Dy.
It is important to note that the S0→S1 of current system is relatively special, namely its
transition electric dipole moment vector (D) just points towards Z-axis. However, for most practical
cases, the D is not parallel to any of the three Cartesian axes, in this case we are not able to directly
study its source in terms of visualization of any of Tx(r) or Ty(r) or Tz(r). Fortunately, it is quite easy
to reorient the molecule so that the D exactly points towards a selected Cartesian axis, thus making
the above analysis feasible. See Appendix 2 of Section 4.A.7 on how to realize this.
Next, we check isosurface of Tz(r) for S0→S4 excitation. We first return to menu of main
function 18, then repeat above steps, finally you will see

The green and blue isosurfaces occupy the same amount of space, indicating that positive and
negative contributions to Dz are exactly the same, this is why Dz of S0→S4 is zero. Note that the
Tz(r) almost solely distributes on the pyrrole region, this is because this electron excitation
corresponds to local excitation on pyrrole moiety (as shown in Section 4.18.1).
You may have felt that visual study of transition dipole moment density is interesting and useful;
indeed, via this way you can clearly identify contribution to transition dipole moment from different
molecular regions. The cube file of the T(r) as well as Tx(r), Ty(r) and Tz(r) can be exported via
post-processing menu, so that you can also plot them using other visualization software such as
VMD (Section 4.A.14), or use such as basin analysis module (Section 3.20) or domain analysis
module (Section 3.200.14) to further quantify their distributions, or plot them as plane map via main
function 4 (using interpolated function based on loaded grid data, i.e. user-defined function -1).
Visualizing transition magnetic dipole moment density
The transition dipole moment we discussed above is transition electric dipole moment. There
are also other kinds of transition dipole moments, such as transition velocity dipole moment and
transition magnetic dipole moment. Multiwfn is also capable of calculating transition magnetic
dipole moment and plotting the corresponding density isosurface map, related knowledge can be
found in "Theory 5" of Section 3.21.1. Since this quantity is less important than transition electric
dipole moment, I will not discuss it deeply, but only give a simple example. Using the .out and .fch
files of N-phenylpyrrole, we first enter hole-electron module and select the second excited state,
then input
-1 // By default, transition magnetic dipole moment density is not calculated by option 1 of
hole-electron module for saving time, we select this option now to make option 1 also calculate this
quantity
1 // Visualize and analyze hole, electron, transition density and so on
2 // Medium quality grid
Once the calculation is finished, from screen you can find the transition magnetic dipole
moment evaluated based on the grid data:
Transition magnetic dipole moment in X/Y/Z: -0.503315

0.000119 -0.000177 a.u.

Then we select option 9 and select the component of transition magnetic dipole moment density

that you are interested in, after that you will see the corresponding isosurface map. Below map is X
component of transition magnetic dipole moment density plotted under isovalue of 0.005. The
relatively larger blue region compared to green region explains why the X component of transition
magnetic dipole moment is a negative value (-0.503 a.u.).

4.18.2.2 Plotting and analyzing transition density matrix (TDM)
Note: There is a video illustrating the procedure of using Multiwfn and Origin to plot the transition density
matrix, see https://youtu.be/JPlZk4Aa6bQ.

The transition density matrix (TDM) has been carefully introduced in Section 3.21.2, heat map
of TDM is particularly useful in understanding the nature of electron excitation, please read Section
3.21.2 first. In this section, we will analyze transition character of a linear system of donor-acceptor type by means of the TDM heat map. The molecular structure is shown below.

The Gaussian output file as well as .fchk file can be found in "examples\excit\NH2_C8_NO2" folder,
the keyword is CAM-B3LYP/6-31G* IOp(9/40=4) TD(nstates=10).
It is worth to note that the TDM is closely related to the charge transfer matrix defined in holeelectron analysis framework. Example of plotting heat map of charge transfer matrix is given in
Section 4.18.8.2. Usually heat maps of TDM and charge transfer matrix are very similar to each
other and convey basically the same information.
Atom transition density matrix
First, we plot heat map of "atom TDM", namely the index of the TDM corresponds to atom
index. Commonly, this kind of map is only suitable for studying chain-like systems such as present

molecule, otherwise the indices in the heat map will be difficult to be mapped to actual atoms in the
molecule. For systems with more complicated shape, typically "fragment TDM" should be plotted
instead, it will be described later.
Note that in "atom TDM", hydrogens are commonly ignored because they rarely contribute to
excitations of chemical interest. Therefore, before the excited state calculation of present molecule,
the indices of the hydrogens have been moved to the back of heavy atoms. As can be seen from the
molecular structure graph shown above, the range of heavy atoms is 1~12, while that of hydrogens
is 13~22.
Here we first study S0→S1 transition of this system. The below used fchk and out files are
yielded using CAM-B3LYP/6-31G* IOp(9/40=4) TD(nstates=10) keywords. Boot up Multiwfn and

Below map is immediately shown on screen, the pink line was manually added to highlight the
diagonal, the "hole" and "electron" texts were also manually labelled. By default, the lower limit of
color scale is 0, while upper limit is the largest matrix element.

Electron excitation can be regarded as hole→electron transition. As introduced in Section
3.21.2, the diagonal terms of TDM heat map can reflect that in which atoms the hole and electron
simultaneously have large distribution. For off-diagonal elements, we should first examine X-axis

792

4 Tutorials and Examples
(corresponding to hole position) and then Y-axis (corresponding to electron position), we will be
able to recognize how electrons transfer among different sites. In the TDM map of present instance,
most elements in the diagonal are surrounded by green or red color, therefore this excitation must
be a global excitation, namely the excited electrons distribute over the whole system. The matrix
elements are not symmetric with respect to diagonal, it can be clearly seen that the upper left part
of the map is larger than the lower right part, in particular, the elements near the diagonal have
relatively large value. This observation reveals that electrons on non-hydrogen atoms are transferred
to atoms adjacent to them, more specifically, electrons on the atoms with smaller index tend to
transfer to atoms with larger index. Since the index of non-hydrogen atoms is ordered from the
amino group to the nitro group, hence it can be inferred that this S0→S1 excitation causes the
electrons to move integrally from the amino end to the nitro end.
If you feel difficult to understand above texts, you can compare the TDM map with below
hole&electron isosurface map (see Section 4.18.1 on how to plot it). You can find the TDM heat
map and the isosurface map convey similar information, and can confirm all of our conclusions
drawn based on the TDM map.

If you want to plot TDM heat map for other excited state, you can exit the heat map plotting
function, then re-enter this function and select the state to be studied. It is worth to note that if you
choose option "4 Toggle if taking hydrogens into account" once to switch its status to "Yes" and
then replot, you will see below map

The index range of hydrogens are 13~22, above map shows that hydrogens indeed do not evidently
participlate in electron excitation because their elements are very small (represented as purple color),
clearly it is meaningless to include hydrogens into S0→S1 TDM heat map.

Let us check another excitation, S0→S2. The heat map and hole&electron isosurface map are
given below.

The upper right corner of the heat map has a large value area, which corresponds to the nitro group
at the end of the system, therefore the hole and electron must have large distribution at the same
time in this region. In addition, the value of the off-diagonal terms of rightmost column of the image
is not very small, so it can be considered that the nitro group transfers a certain amount of electrons
to the central region of the system, which is consistent with the phenomenon that can be seen in the
hole&electron isosurface map. This observation can also be described as there is a so-called
"coherence" between the nitro moiety and the intermediate region of the system in the S0→S2
excitation.
Fragment transition density matrix
Below we will plot TDM heat map based on fragment, namely the index of the map
corresponds to the index of self-defined fragments. The advantage of this kind of TDM map is that
the system to be studied is not necessarily linear, any shape of system (e.g. ring, star) can also be
easily investigated.
The system to be investigated next is shown below, the molecule is divided as five fragments,
which are represented as different colors. The Gaussian input, output and fchk files, as well as other
files involved in the following texts can be downloaded from http://sobereva.com/attach/436/file.rar.

We first study S0→S1 excitation. Boot up Multiwfn and input

2 // Plot heat map of transition matrix
tdmat.out
1 // Study S0→S1 excitation
n // Do not symmetrize the newly generated TDM
1 // Use the way 1 to contract the TDM represented in basis functions to atom TDM
Now you can choose option 1 to plot atom TDM. However, our present aim is to plot fragment
TDM. In order to do this, we can create a plain text file (which has already been provided as
tdmfrag.txt in the file.rar package), each line of it defines a fragment, the content of the file in this
example is
1-23
24-33
34-43
44-55
56-63

Note that you can also use such as 2,5-8,12-15,20 to define a batch of atoms with discontinuous
indices as a fragment.
Then input below commands
-1 // Define fragments
0 // Load fragment definition from an external file (as prompted, you can also directly input
atom indices)
tdmfrag.txt // The file containing fragment definition
5 // Modify range of color scale
0,0.4 // Lower and upper limit
1 // Plot heat map
Now you can see below graph, whose index corresponds to fragment index, the hole&electron
isosurface map is also given together for comparison. The region marked with a blue frame is the
4th fragment (hexatriene).

According to the colors in the heat map, we know that electron and hole are mainly distributed
on the fragment 4, but they also simultaneously appear on fragments 1 and 5 to some extent, these
finding are consistent with the situation exhibited by the isosurface. Since no off-diagonal element
in the graph is quite large, present electron excitation does not cause a significant electron transfer
between various fragments. Roughly speaking, the main feature of this excitation is local excitation
on fragment 4.
Analogously, we plot fragment TDM between ground state and each of S2~S7 excited states,
the resulting maps are collectively shown below

The values of the off-diagonal elements in the maps of S0→S2~S5 are not significant with
respect to their diagonal elements, therefore interfragment electron transfer should not be obvious.
According to the diagonal terms, we can find that the transitions of S0→S2 and S0→S3 mainly
occurred in the fragment 1, while S0→S2 also marginally involves fragment 4. In general, both the

796

4 Tutorials and Examples
transitions can be regarded as local excitation. The S0→S4 is evidently a global excitation since all
diagonal terms are conspicuous. Main character of S0→S5 is local excitation on the fragment 3,
which corresponds to a benzene ring, but its neighboring fragments are also more or less involved.
S0→S6 and S0→S7 are somewhat mirrored with each other, from the figure it can be seen that
almost every fragment is involved during electron excitation, they either occupied by hole
distribution, electron distribution, or both. For S0→S6, we can speculate that the fragments 2, 3,
and 4 transferred certain amount of electrons to the fragment 1 because (1,2), (1,3) and (1,4)
elements are large, and meantime the fragments 3 and 5 also transferred some electrons to the
fragment 4.
Above figure and discussion obviously show that, when you want to discuss transition
character from ground state to a large number of excited states at the same time when writing an
article, it is very straightforward to provide a figure containing TDM heat maps of all excitations.
Skill: Plotting TDM heat map for a batch of excited states using shell script
If you want to study a batch of excited states in terms of TDM heat map, while you feel that
plotting map one by one is laborious, you can use Linux shell script to fully automate this process.
The script that generates the fragment TDM heat maps for specified range of excited states at
one time is examples\scripts\allTDM.sh. For example, if you put tdmat.fchk, tdmat.out, tdmfrag.txt,
and allTDM.sh used in above example into the Multiwfn directory and then enter this folder, run
chmod +x allTDM.sh to add executable permissions, and then run ./allTDM.sh, this script will
automatically call Multiwfn to generate 1.png, 2.png ... until 7.png in the current directory, they
correspond to TDM heat map of S0→S1, S0→S2 ... to S0→S7. The entire process can be completed
in a blink of an eye, clearly using the script is extremely convenient.

4.18.2.3 Plotting and analyzing transition dipole moment matrix
In fact, the heat map plotting function illustrated in last section is a general module, it can also
plot other kind of atom or fragment matrix. In Section 3.21.11, the concept of atom transition dipole
moment matrix (atom TDMM) is introduced. This matrix has three components X, Y and Z. For
example, the sum of all elements of the X component matrix just corresponds to the X component
of transition dipole moment. Therefore, by plotting TDMM as heat map, we are able to make clear
which atoms or fragments have conspicuous contributions to transition dipole moment.
Below, we still use the donor--acceptor employed in Section 4.18.2.2 as example to show how
to plot TDMM as heat map. Multiwfn is able to plot both transition electric dipole moment matrix
and transition magnetic dipole moment matrix, present section will limit to the former one.
Initially we need to generate a file containing atom TDMM. Boot up Multiwfn and input
examples\excit\NH2_C8_NO2\NH2_C8_NO2.fchk
18 // Electron excitation analysis
11 // Decompose transition dipole moment as basis function and atom contributions
examples\excit\NH2_C8_NO2\NH2_C8_NO2.out
1 // Study S0→S1 excitation
1 // The transition dipole moment to be studied is "electric"
y // Export atom TDMM
As shown in screen, matrices have been exported to .txt files in current folder with "AAtrdip"

prefix, in which the AAtrdipX.txt contains the X component of atom TDMM. Next we will plot heat
map based on this matrix.
Reboot Multiwfn and input
o // Load the file last time loaded
18 // Electron excitation analysis
2 // Plot heat map of transition matrix
AAtrdipX.txt
Now you can find below information on screen
Sum of all elements (including hydrogens):

-4.38875223

Maximum and minimum (including hydrogens):

0.65818572

Sum of all elements (without hydrogens):

-2.86353889

Maximum and minimum (without hydrogens):

0.65818572

-0.82543408

-0.82543408

where -4.38875223 is just the X component of transition electric dipole moment of S0→S1
excitation, the value is identical to that can be found from Gaussian output file.
As also shown in above prompt, the minimum value of this matrix is a negative value -0.825,
however by default the lower limit of color scale of present function is 0, therefore we must change
the color scale, and it is better to make absolute value of lower and upper limits identical. You can
repeatedly try to find the value that makes the image best reflect the characteristics of the matrix. If
the range is too narrow, the parts that exceed the upper and lower limits of the color scale will be
displayed as white and black, respectively, which is not beautiful. If the range is too broad, the
difference of the matrix elements can hardly be distinguished by colors.
Now we input below commands in Multiwfn
5 // Modify range of color scale
-0.7,0.7 // Lower and upper limits
1 // Plot heat map
Immediately you can see below graph. In order to better understand the heat map, the isosurface
of transition dipole moment density of X component is also shown together (see Section 4.18.2.1
on how to plot it)

The bluer (redder) matrix element of this heat map contributes more negatively (positively) to the
transition dipole moment of X component. Since most part of the heat map are blue, the sum of all
matrix elements must be negative, explaining why the X component of the transition dipole moment
is a significant negative value (-4.388 a.u.). Because all matrix elements far from the diagonal are
very close to 0 (shown as green), hence the long-range coupling between atoms does not contribute
substantially to the transition dipole moment of X component. There are several areas of the figure
show very blue color, such as the regions near (2,2) and (9,9), showing that corresponding atoms
and neighboring ones have significant negative contributions, this point is also clearly reflected in
the isosurface map of transition dipole moment density. Some sites such as (1,2) are obviously
positive, which means that the coupling between the two atoms has a significant positive
contribution to the transition dipole moment of X component, this is also why in the isosurface map
there are green isosurfaces between atoms 1 and 2. The middle part of the heat map is basically
green, indicating that the value is very small; correspondingly, there is no isosurface in the middle
of the molecule on the isosurface map.
It can be seen that combining the transition dipole moment density and the transition dipole
moment matrix together is helpful for clarifying the intrinsic characteristics of the transition dipole
moment.
We can also plot TDMM based on fragment index, this is very easy and thus will not be further
illustrated. What you need to do is simply defining fragments in the heat map plotting function and
then plot the graph (please recall Section 4.18.2.3).

4.18.2.4 Investigating transition density and transition density matrix
between excited states
In last several sections, I have illustrated how to study transition character in terms of transition

(dipole moment) density as real space function and transition (dipole moment) density matrix
between ground state and excited states. In fact, these kinds of studies can also be used to analyze
transition between two excited states, such analyses may be useful in special applications, such as
transient absorption spectrum and two-photon process. In this section, I will show how to realize
these analyses.
Analysis of transition density in real space function between excited states
As shown in Section 4.18.2.1, Multiwfn is able to easily generate grid data of transition density
between ground state and a selected excited state. In fact transition density between two excited
states can also be generated. To do so, we should first generate transition density matrix (TDM)
between the two states, however, since all analyses related to real space function in Multiwfn are
based on orbitals, we then need to transform the TDM to corresponding natural orbitals. Finally, the
electron density evaluated based on these natural orbitals will directly correspond to transition
density.
Here S2→S3 transition of N-phenylpyrrole is taken as an example, below procedure will
generate cube file of corresponding transition density. Boot up Multiwfn and input
examples\excit\N-phenylpyrrole.fch
18 // Electron excitation analysis
9 // Generate and export transition density matrix
2 // Generate transition density matrix between (TDM) two excited states
examples\excit\N-phenylpyrrole.out
2,3 // Assume that you want to analyze S2→S3 transition
[Press ENTER button directly to use default threshold]
y // Symmetrize the resulting TDM in usual way
y // Export present wavefunction information including the newly generated TDM to TDM.fch
in current folder
Reboot Multiwfn and input
TDM.fch
200 // Other function, part 2
16 // Generate natural orbitals based on the density matrix in .fch/.fchk file
SCF // We input this because the "Total SCF Density" field in the TDM.fch currently
correspond to S2→S3 TDM
y // Export new.mwfn, which contains natural orbitals corresponding to S2→S3 TDM, and then
let Multiwfn directly load it
0 // Return to main menu
5 // Calculate grid data
1 // Electron density
2 // Medium quality grid
2 // Export cube file
Now the generated density.cub in current records transition density between S2 and S3, you can also
choose option -1 to directly visualize the isosurface.
It is also possible to generate grid data of transition dipole moment density between excited
states. For example, if you set “iuserfunc” parameter in settings.ini to 22, which sets user-defined
function to −𝑥𝜌(𝐫), then when you use the new.mwfn generated previously as input file, the userdefined function will correspond to X component of transition dipole moment density of S2→S3

transition. Clearly, what you should do next is calculating grid data of user-defined function.
Heat map of transition density matrix between excited states
Here we use the NH2-C8-NO2.fchk and NH2-C8-NO2.out employed in Section 4.18.2.2 as
example to illustrate how to plot heat map of transition density matrix between two arbitrarily
selected excited states, S1 and S2.
Boot up Multiwfn and input
examples\excit\NH2_C8_NO2\NH2_C8_NO2.fchk
18 // Electron excitation analysis
9 // Generate transition density matrix
2 // For two excited states
examples\excit\NH2_C8_NO2\NH2_C8_NO2.out
1,2 // The states are chosen as S1 and S2
[Press ENTER button to use default threshold]
0 // Do not symmetrize the resulting TDM
n // Do not yield TDM.fch
Now we have tdmat.txt in current folder, which records TDM of S1→S2.
Reboot Multiwfn and then input
o // Load the file last time loaded
18 // Electron excitation analysis
2 // Plot heat map for transition matrix
tdmat.txt // Matrix data will be loaded form this file
1 // Construct atom transition matrix in terms of way 1
1 // Plot heat map
The obtained graph is shown below, the isosurface map of density difference yielded by
subtracting S1 density from S2 density is also given (see Section 4.18.13 on how to plot it).

Since the area corresponding to atoms 1~9 at the right side (X=11 and 12) of the heat map has large
value, we can speculate that a large amount of electrons is transferred from atoms 11 and 12 to atoms
1~9 during the S1→S2 excitation. Exactly same conclusion can also be gained from the isosurface
map of density difference. This example shows that the density matrix heat map is not only useful
and reliable for analyzing transitions from ground state to excited states, but also for transitions
between various excited states.

4.18.3 Analyze charge-transfer during electron excitation based on
electron density difference
In this instance we will analyze charge-transfer (CT) between the first singlet excited state and
ground state of the molecule shown below in ethanol solvent, which will be referred to as P2. The
related theory has been introduced in Section 3.21.3. The discussions in this example are somewhat
related to the ones involved in Section 4.18.1, however the methods employed in this section are
purely based on electron density difference.

Since the .wfn files corresponding to the excited state and ground state are large, they are not
provided. Instead, the input files of Gaussian for generating the two .wfn files are provided in
“examples\excit” folder (extP2.gjf and basP2.gjf). I assume that the corresponding .wfn files are
produced at "CT" subfolder in current folder. I would like to remind you once again, the geometries
in the wavefunction files of the two states must be exactly identical, otherwise the result will be
meaningless! If you do not have Gaussian in hand, you can also directly download the extP2.wfn
and basP2.wfn from http://sobereva.com/multiwfn/extrafiles/extP2_basP2.zip.
First, we calculate grid data of electron density variation  during the excitation. Boot up
Multiwfn and input:
CT\extP2.wfn // Excited state wavefunction file
5 // Generate grid data
0 // Set custom operation
1 // Only one file will be dealt with
-,CT\basP2.wfn // Ground state wavefunction file. Corresponding density will be subtracted
from the excited one to generate 
1 // Electron density
2 // Medium quality grid. If the system is much larger than present one, more grid points is
required (e.g. using high quality grid)
Once the calculation is normally completed, you can choose option -1 to view the electron
density variation during the electron excitation (default isovalue is too large for visualizing density
difference, 0.005 is recommended for present case). Green and blue regions correspond to positive
and negative regions, respectively, they represent increase and decrease in electron density due to
the excitation.

Above information is self-explanatory, if you are confused, please consult Section 3.21.3. The
evident positive value of t index implies that the distribution of positive and negative of  has been
significantly separated due to strong CT. The large D index (4.95 Å) shows that the CT distance is
quite long. Clearly, S0→S1 transition of this system should be identified as typical CT excitation.
The excitation caused significant variation of dipole moment, as shown in the data, it is as high as
20.07 Debye. The distribution spatial distribution breadth of positive and negative parts of  are
similar, therefore the outputted  index, which measures difference of their RMSD, is merely 0.247 Å.
By selecting option 1, isosurface of C+ (green) and C- (blue) functions can be shown up. The
isovalue of the graph shown below is 0.0015.

If the isovalue is increased to 0.0024, the positions of barycenters can be approximately located
(barycenters of C+ and C- exactly correspond to center of their isosurfaces).

From the graph it is evident that the direction of electron transfer is from the amino group side
(electron donor) to nitro group side (electron acceptor). However, the barycenters are not exactly
located at the two substituents, this observation suggests that the actual electron donor in this
electron excitation is not amino group but phenyl. This finding parallels to the fact that phenyl is a
weak electron donor.
Hint: If you would like to get better display effect of the C+ and C- isosurfaces, you can use VMD program
(freely available at http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/) to display them, the procedure is: Boot up VMD first,
drag Cpos.cub into VMD main window, and then drag Cneg.cub into it. Select "Graphics"-"Representations", choose
the first term in "Selected Molecule", click "Create Rep" button to create a new representation (the existing
representation is used to show molecular structure), change the "drawing method" to "isosurface", set "Draw" to
"solid surface", change the isovalue to 0.0015, set "coloring method" to "ColorID" and choose "7 green". Now the
isosurface of Cpos has been properly displayed. Next, choose the second term in "Selected Molecule", use the similar
methods to set each options, but select "0 blue" in "ColorID", and use isovalue of -0.0015. Finally, the graph will
look like the one shown above. You can also set "Material" to "transparent" so that the overlap region of C+ and Ccan be clearly distinguished.

4.18.4 Calculate ∆r and Λ indices to characterize various electron
excitations for N-phenylpyrrole
In this section I will illustrate how to calculate the r index proposed in J. Chem. Theory
Comput., 9, 3118 (2013) and the  index proposed in J. Chem. Phys., 128, 044118 (2008) to
characterize electron excitations for N-phenylpyrrole. If you are not familiar with these two indices,

please check Section 3.21.4 and Section 3.21.14, respectively.
In my personal view of point, using the quantities such as D and Sr indices defined in holeelectron framework to characterize electron excitation is already absolutely sufficient, as illustrated
in Section 4.18.1. Theoretically, the r and  indices may be regarded as approximations of D and
Sr, respectively. The only advantage of r and  is that in Multiwfn, they can be outputted for all
selected excited states at the same time and can be decomposed into orbital pair contributions. In
addition, calculation cost of r index is almost negligible.
The files used in this section is the N-phenylpyrrole.fch and N-phenylpyrrole.out in
"examples\excit" folder, they were yielded by Gaussian, the keywords are CAM-B3LYP/6-31+G(d)
TD(nstates=5) IOp(9/40=4). Since the optimized ground state geometry was used in the calculation,
therefore the analysis results can be regarded as corresponding to vertical absorption process.
Calculating r index
The r index is a quantitative indicator for measuring charge transfer (CT) length of electron
excitation, larger r index implies longer CT distance.
Boot up Multiwfn and input

The r indices imply that the excitations from ground state (S0) to the 3th, 4th and 5th excited
states possess strong CT character since they have large r, while the excitations of S0→S1 and
S0→S2 should be basically regarded as LE excitations because their r indices are not quite large
(the original paper of r suggests using 2.0 Å as criterion for distinguishing LE and CT excitations).
Bear in mind, definitive conclusion about the excitation character can only be finally drawn after
visualizing the hole and electron distributions using the hole-electron analysis module of Multiwfn.
In Multiwfn it is possible to decompose the r index as contributions of orbital pair transitions.
For example, we want to do this for the S0→S4 excitation, we should first enter the r index
calculation interface and then input
4 // Only calculate r index for a single excitation (S0→S4), in this case the result can be
decomposed

As you can see, MO37→MO41 transition has predominating contribution (1.97 Å) to the r

(0.97 Å).
Calculating  (lambda) index
The  index essentially measures overlapping degree of hole and electron of electron
excitations. Here we calculate it for all the five excitations for N-phenylpyrrole.
Boot up Multiwfn and input

From above output, it can be found that the  indices are nearly inversely proportional to the
r indices, because the larger the hole-electron overlapping extent, usually the shorter the holeelectron separation distance (but bear in mind, this relationship is not always true).
Then we decompose the  index for the fourth excitation. Input below commands
y // Do the  index analysis again
4 // The fourth excitation
y // Decompose analysis on  index
0.01 // Printing threshold
Then you will see all MO pairs having contribution to  index larger than 0.01:

4.18.5 Calculate dipole moment of each excited state and transition
dipole moment between all states for 4-nitroaniline
This example will utilize the function described in Section 3.21.5, please read it first to gain
relevant knowledge. In this example I use 4-nitroaniline to illustrate how to calculate electric dipole
moment of each state, and then illustrate how to calculate transition magnetic dipole moment
between all states. The state in this context refers to ground state and excited states obtained by
TDDFT calculation. The corresponding Gaussian TDDFT input file for generating the .fch and .out

4.18.6 Generate and analyze natural transition orbitals (NTOs) for
uracil
Note: Chinese version of this section is my blog article “Using Multiwfn to perform natural transition orbital
(NTO) analysis” (http://sobereva.com/377), which contains extended discussions.

In this section I illustrate how to use Multiwfn to perform the very popular natural transition
orbital (NTO) analysis with uracil as example. Please first read Section 3.21.6 to acquire basic
knowledge of NTO. Although in this example the files outputted by Gaussian were used as input
file, in fact the files outputted by ORCA are also fully supported, see Section 3.21.1.2 for detailed
requirement about the input file.
Before showing how to perform NTO analysis, I would like to let you apprehend why NTO
analysis is meaningful. As an instance, we use Gaussian to perform TDDFT calculation at PBE0/631G* level for singlet excited states of uracil, you will find below information

Clearly, in excitation of S0→S3, there is no dominant MO transition, the largest contribution of a
single MO pair is merely 0.541^2*2*100%=58.5%, therefore it is impossible to identify the nature
of this excitation by viewing only one MO pair. In such difficult cases, NTO analysis is often useful,
because after transforming MOs to NTOs, commonly you will be able to find only one pair of NTO
having eigenvalue very close to 1, transition between the two NTOs in this pair faithfully represents
the real character of the electron excitation.
The files needed by NTO analysis have mentioned at the beginning of Section 3.21. Briefly,
assume that you are a Gaussian user and you want to study electron excitation from ground state to
the lowest three singlet excited states for uracil at TD-PBE0/6-31G* level, what you need to do is
carrying out a normal TDDFT calculation with these keywords: # PBE1PBE/6-31G* TD
IOp(9/40=4), also you need to make Gaussian generate corresponding .fch file. The input file,
output file and .fch file have already been provided in "examples\excit\NTO" folder. The keyword
IOp(9/40=4) is very important, without it the NTO result will be evidently inaccurate, the meaning

808

of this IOp has been mentioned in Section 4.18.1.
Now we start to carry out NTO analysis. Boot up Multiwfn and input
examples\excit\NTO\uracil.fch
18 // Electron excitation analysis
6 // Generate NTOs
examples\excit\NTO\uracil.out // Gaussian calculated three lowest excited states, you can
analyze any one of them
3 // Study transition from ground state (S0) to the 3rd excited state (S3)
Now Multiwfn loads transition information of S0→S3 from the Gaussian output file and
generate NTOs, the eigenvalues of NTO pairs are shown below
The highest 10 eigenvalues of NTO pairs:
0.865529

0.134025

0.000582

0.000121

0.000024

0.000016

0.000015

0.000007

0.000006

Sum of all eigenvalues:

1.000387

It can be seen that the largest eigenvalue is 0.8655, that means that NTO pair contributes as high as
86.55% of the S0→S3 transition. So, if we would like to characterize the nature of this transition,
we can only study the occupied NTO and virtual NTO in this NTO pair.
Now you can select if outputting .fch/.mwfn/.molden file containing the NTOs. We choose "3
Output NTO orbitals to .mwfn file" and input the path to output, such as C:\S3.mwfn. After
the .mwfn has been successfully generated, you can reboot Multiwfn and load the S3.mwfn, in main
function 0 you can visualize the NTOs, the orbital energies now correspond to NTO eigenvalues.
To plot the occupied and virtual NTOs corresponding to the NTO pair with 86.55% contribution, in
the GUI of main function 0 you can select "orbital info." - "Show up to LUMO+10" in the menu, in
the text window you will find output like below
Orb:

27 Ene(au/eV):

0.000582

We can see that the occupied NTO with index of 29 and the virtual NTO with index of 30 constitute
the NTO pair with eigenvalue of 0.8655, there we select corresponding index in the GUI to visualize
them, the isosurfaces are shown below

Undoubtedly, this S0→S3 excitation can be regarded as transition from lone pair of O12 to antibonding  orbital of the uracil ring, at least we have 86.55% confidence to say that. From NTO

4 Tutorials and Examples
eigenvalues we notice that NTO28→NTO31 transition also has small contribution (13.40%) to the
excitation, please plot corresponding orbitals and discuss their characteristic.
The NTOs can also be subjected to quantitative analyses. For example, you can enter main
function 8 and use suitable options to analyze their orbital composition at quantitative level, or you
can use subfunction 11 of main function 100 to evaluate overlap extent and centroid distance
between selected two NTOs.
In Multiwfn it is possible to evaluate energies of orbitals in any kind. In Section 4.300.6 a
detailed example of calculating energies of NTO orbitals is given.
It is worth to note that NTO analysis has both advantage and disadvantage with respect to the
hole-electron analysis, this point has been mentioned at the end of Section 3.21.6. For many systems
and excitations, even if NTO transformation has been applied, there are still no NTO pair with
predominant contribution, in this case you have to resort to hole-electron analysis to facilitate
discussion of excitation characteristic. The drawback of hole-electron analysis is that it is unable to
present orbital phase information like NTO analysis, and it takes higher computational cost.
Using script to carry out NTO analysis in batch
Sometimes we want to perform NTO analysis for a batch of excitations, for example, we want
to generate a batch of .fch files that respectively contain NTOs of S0→S1, S0→S2 and S0→S3
transitions, although you can manually do this in the interactive interface of Multiwfn, a more
efficient and clever way is employing shell script. If you are a Linux user, we can run below shell
script to yield S1.fch, S2.fch and S3.fch, which contain NTOs corresponding to S0→S1, S0→S3 and
S0→S3. This script is very easy to understand as long as if you have basic level of knowledge about
shell programming.
#!/bin/bash
cat << EOF > allNTO.txt

done
./Multiwfn examples/excit/NTO/uracil.fch < allNTO.txt
rm ./allNTO.txt

This script is also provided as examples\excit\NTO\allNTO.sh. If you do not make any modification
to the script, this script should be copied to the Multiwfn folder and run as ./allNTO.sh in Multiwfn
folder, then S1.fch, S2.fch and S3.fch will be yielded at the same folder. In practical studies, you
should properly modify the script according to actual situation, the range of the excitations to be
studied is determined by "i=1;i<=3".

4.18.8 Using IFCT method and heat map of charge transfer matrix to
study interfragment charge transfer during electron excitation
The interfragment charge transfer (IFCT) is a method derived based on hole-electron analysis
for quantitatively studying amount of charge transfer between different fragments. The situation of
charge transfer can also be very intuitively understood by means of heat map of charge transfer
matrix, which is a byproduct of IFCT analysis. Please carefully read Section 3.21.8 if you are not
familiar with these concepts.
In the next two sections, I will use two molecules to respectively illustrate how to perform
IFCT analysis and plot heat map of charge transfer matrix, these two kinds of analyses can provide
complementary perspectives.

4.18.8.1 IFCT analysis for 4-nitroaniline
In this example, I will illustrate how to use IFCT method to study CT between three fragments
(-NO2, -NH2 and the linker benzene) of 4-nitroaniline during its electron excitation.

The Gaussian input file of TDDFT task at PBE0/6-311G* level for 4-nitroaniline has been
provided as examples\excit\4-nitroaniline.gjf. Note that IOp(9/40=4) is used so that Gaussian can
print enough configuration coefficients. Run it by Gaussian to obtain .chk file and .out file, then
convert the .chk file to .fch via formchk. The .fch and .out files have been provided in
"examples\excit" folder.
Boot up Multiwfn and input below commands
examples\excit\4-nitroaniline.fch
18 // Electron excitation analysis
8 // Calculate interfragment charge transfer in electron excitation via IFCT method
1 // Mulliken partition
[Press ENTER button] // Load examples\excit\4-nitroaniline.out

3 // Define three fragments
11-13 // Atomic indices of amino group (fragment 1)
1-10 // Atomic indices of benzene group (fragment 2)
14-16 // Atomic indices of nitro group (fragment 3)
Then you will see

The output is very easy to understand, if you are confused, please check corresponding
explanation in Section 3.21.8. For example, the data shows that during the S0→S2 excitation, nitro
group (fragment 3) donates 0.00179 electrons to amino group (fragment 1) and meantime accept
0.19001 electrons from amino group, therefore nitro group totally gains 0.18821 electron from
amino group. If the benzene fragment is also taken into account, the electron excitation totally
increases electron population of nitro group by 0.61519. The electron redistribution phenomenon in
the two terminal groups is not prominent, however, as the data shown (0.19453), the electron
redistribution within the benzene, which behaves as  linker, is remarkable. Because CT(%) is
notably larger than LE(%), this excitation can be mostly regarded as a charge transfer state.
For facilitating discussion, I summarized all IFCT analysis data in below table. The diagonal
terms correspond to amount of intrafragment electron redistribution.

As you can see from the table, there are three prominent interfragment CT terms (sorted according
to magnitude): benzene→nitro, amino→nitro, amino→benzene, all of them direct from amino
group towards nitro group.
For better and intuitively understanding above data, we plot hole-electron isosurface map using
the method described in Section 4.18.1:

In the graph, main distribution regions of hole and electron correspond to blue and green,
respectively. As you can see, hole mainly distributes on the amino group and benzene moiety, while
electron mainly locates at the benzene linker and nitro group, clearly the overall CT direction is
from amino group to nitro group, this is completely in line with our observation of quantitative
interfragment CT analysis.
Using Hirshfeld partition
Commonly, the Mulliken-like partition, as what we have employed in this example, is a good
choice because its calculation is quite fast and the result is usually reasonable. Unfortunately, it is
incompatible with diffuse functions, and sometimes there are unphysical negative fragment
contributions to hole or electron. When diffuse functions must be adopted (e.g. anionic system), or
Multiwfn warns you that there are negative contributions, you should use the more robust Hirshfeld
partition instead. It works well for any case, but the cost is markedly higher. To change to the
Hirshfeld partition, you simply need to input 2 when Multiwfn asks you to select the method for
calculating hole and electron composition. The data in above example calculated by Hirshfeld
partition is shown below; as you can see, the result is approximately identical to the result under
Mulliken-like partition.

hence can easily recognize major character of all excited states, see Section 4.18.6 for illustration.

"Using the IFCT method in Multiwfn to evaluate amount of electron transfer between arbitrarily
defined two fragments during electron excitation" (in Chinese, http://sobereva.com/433).

4.18.8.2 Plotting heat map of charge transfer matrix to intuitively understand
nature of electron excitation
The charge transfer matrix (CTM) is closely related to transition density matrix (TDM) and
their heat maps often provide similar information for an electron excitation. The method of plotting
TDM has been illustrated in Section 4.18.2.2. In my opinion, the physical meaning of CTM is
somewhat more clear than TDM and can better reveal actual charge transfer character. In addition,
since CTM is derived in the theory framework of hole-electron analysis (see Section 3.21.1), the
CTM heat map can always well compare with distribution of hole and electron.
Here I still use the molecule studied in Section 4.18.2.2 as instance. Before plotting the heat
map of CTM, we should first generate CTM. Boot up Multiwfn and input
examples\excit\NH2_C8_NO2\NH2_C8_NO2.fchk
18 // Electron excitation analysis
8 // IFCT analysis
1 // Mulliken-like partition to derive atomic contribution to hole and electron
examples\excit\NH2_C8_NO2\NH2_C8_NO2.out
1 // Study S0→S1 excitation
-1 // Export atom-atom CTM to atmCTmat.txt in current folder
2 // Enter the function used for plotting heat map
atmCTmat.txt // Load matrix data from this file
1 // Show heat map
Now you can see below map, the purple line and texts are manually added.

This figure has similar features of the heat map of atom TDM given in Section 4.18.2.2, but there
are also differences that cannot be ignored. According to the IFCT point of view, each of the nondiagonal elements of the current graph rigorously exhibits the amount of electron transferred
between atoms. Looking at the graph column by column, it can be visually seen that each atom on

814

--- page break ---

4 Tutorials and Examples
the carbon chain transferred electrons to the atoms at its front and back ends, and the amount of
transfer to the nitro side is significantly more than to the amino side. For example, it can be seen
from the figure that in the fifth column, the value of the sixth element is larger than the fourth
element, so the amount of electron transfer of C5→C6 must be more than C5→C4.
Next, we also look into heat map of CTM of other excitation. The map of S0→S9 plotted in
the same way as above is given below, corresponding hole&electron isosurface map is also
appended. Because it was found that S0→S9 transition evidently involves some hydrogens,
therefore hydrogens are also taken into account in the map (by choosing "4 Toggle if taking
hydrogens into account" once).

It can be seen from the above heat map that, there is strong electron transfer from the region of
atoms 1~5 and 7~9 to the hydrogen atom with index of 13, this observation fully agrees with the
hole&electron isosurface map, namely there is a large green isosurface at the H13. In addition, from
the isosurface map we can see that atom 6 is basically only surrounded by green isosurface, that
means this atom does not transfer electrons to others while largely accepts electrons from others;
accordingly, the color of the row of Y=6 in the heat map is distinct, while the column corresponding
to X=6 is very dark.
From this example, we can find that the hole&electron isosurface map provides the most
intuitive visual effect, but if it is discussed together with the heat map of CTM, the charge transfer
can be understood more thoroughly from a quantitative point of view, it also avoids the possibility
that the arbitrariness of the choice of isovalue leads to an unreasonable judgment.
The CTM can also be plotted based on fragment. To do this, you simply need to load fragment
definition file or directly input fragment definition in the heat map plotting function, and then plot
the map again.

4.18.9 Generate transition density matrix and transform it to orbital
representation
Note: This section may be not interesting for most Multiwfn users, but valuable for experts

In Section 4.18.2, I have shown that in Multiwfn the transition density can be studied in terms
of real space function and colored matrix (heat map). Multiwfn can do even more for transition
density. As will illustrated in this section, Multiwfn is able to transform the generated transition
density matrix to orbital representation and export the orbitals as wavefunction file. This brings a
lot of conveniences; for example, when you analyze "electron density" based on this file, the actual
function to be studied will directly correspond to transition density. Note that these orbitals can be
regarded as natural orbitals of transition density matrix (TDM), but they are remarkably different to
the NTO (nature transition orbital), which has been introduced in Section 3.21.6.
Here will take the N-phenylpyrrole as example, whose transition density of S0→S1 has been
plotted as isosurface in Section 4.18.2. Our purpose in this section is to transform this transition
density as orbitals and export them as .wfx file so that then we can very easily study properties of
the transition density based on this file.
First we generate a .fch file containing TDM. Boot up Multiwfn and input
examples\excit\N-phenylpyrrole.fch // The .fch file yielded by Gaussian TDDFT task
18 // Electron excitation analysis
9 // Generate and export TDM
1 // Generate TDM between ground state and excited state
examples\excit\N-phenylpyrrole.out // The output file of Gaussian TDDFT task with
IOp(9/40=4) keyword
1 // Analyze electron transition from ground state to the 1st excited state (S0→S1)
1 // Symmetrize the raw TDM. This is important, the natural orbitals cannot be properly
yielded later without symmetrization of the TDM
y // Export current wavefunction to TDM.fch in current folder, whose "Total SCF Density"
field records the just generated symmetrized TDM
Next, we transform the TDM to natural orbitals. Reboot Multiwfn and input
TDM.fch
200 // Other functions (Part 2)
16 // Generate natural orbitals based on the density matrix in .fch/.fchk file
SCF // The matrix to be transformed comes from the "Total SCF Density" field
y // Export the generated orbitals to new.mwfn and load it
Now we have new.mwfn in current folder, which contains natural orbitals transformed from the
S0→S1 TDM. The orbitals in memory now also correspond to these natural orbitals. Assume that
we also want to export them as .wfx file, we should input below commands
0 // Return to main menu
100 // Other functions (Part 1)
2 // Export various kinds of files

4 Tutorials and Examples
4 // Output current wavefunction as .wfx file
TDM.wfx // The path of the file to be generated
In the future, if you use the TDM.wfx as input file and calculate grid data of "electron density"
via main function 5, you will find the resulting isosurface map (after properly adjusting isovalue) is
exactly identical to the transition density T(r) graph shown in Section 4.18.2.1.

4.18.10 Obtain molecular orbital pair contributions to transition dipole
moment
In order to gain a deeper insight into transition electric or magnetic dipole moment, Multiwfn
provides a function used to decompose it to contributions from various MO pair transitions, see
Section 3.21.10 for introduction. Here I present an example. The .fch and .out files involved in this
example were produced by TDDFT calculation of Gaussian.
Boot up Multiwfn and input
examples\excit\N-phenylpyrrole.fch
18 // Electron excitation analysis
10 // Decompose transition dipole moment as molecular orbital pair contributions
1 // The type of transition dipole moment is electric
examples\excit\N-phenylpyrrole.out
1 // Select the excitation from ground state (S0) to the first singlet excited state (S1)
Now below information about this excitation is shown on screen

Then you can find several options on screen, they are self-explanatory. We first choose option

When there are too many MO pairs having nonnegligible contributions to transition dipole
moment and thus difficult to identify important MO transitions, you can let Multiwfn sort the MO

By the way, oscillator strength (f) directly relates to square of norm of transition electric dipole
moment, therefore it can be expected that if the configuration coefficient corresponding to
MO38→MO39 is set to zero, namely ignoring its contribution, then f will be lowered evidently. As
shown earlier, the original f of S0→S1 is 0.39353. Let us quantitatively check how MO38→MO39
affects the f. To do this, we can manually set configuration coefficient of this transition to zero and
then re-examine the f value. To this aim, we input following commands
0 // Return to menu of electron excitation analysis
-1 // Check, modify and export configuration coefficients of an excitation
1 // Choose the first excited state
1 // Set coefficient of a MO pair
38,39 // The MO indices of the MO pair
1 // The transition type is chosen as "Excitation", hence MO38→MO39 is selected (if inputting
2, then what we selected will be MO38MO39)
0 // Set the configuration coefficient to zero
-3 // Export current excitation information to a plain text file
S1.txt // The path of the file to store excitation information of S0→S1
Now S1.txt has been generated in current folder, if you open it with text editor, you will find
the coefficient corresponding to MO38→MO39 is indeed zero.
Then reboot Multiwfn and input
o // Load the file used at the last time, namely examples\excit\N-phenylpyrrole.fch
18 // Electron excitation analysis
10 // Decompose transition dipole moment as molecular orbital pair contributions
1 // The type of transition dipole moment is electric
S1.txt
Now the printed f is only 0.1278, which is less than 1/3 of its original value (0.39353), showing
that MO38→MO39 has crucial influence on strength of S0→S1 excitation.
Since the coefficient of MO38→MO39 is as large as 0.6727, after setting it to zero, now the sum of the square
of remaining coefficients has been much less than 0.1, which is far from the ideal value of closed-shell case (0.5).

In my paper Carbon, 165, 461 (2020), I employed the function illustrated above to study the
nature of the extremely strong absorption of cyclo[18]carbon, you are suggested to look at Fig. 4

moment as contributions of MO pair transitions, which is useful in studying rotatory strength.

4.18.11 Plot transition dipole moment vector contributed by molecular
fragments as arrows
Note: Chinese version of this section is my blog article “Using Multiwfn+VMD to plot transition dipole moment
vector contributed by specific fragment” (http://sobereva.com/396).

In Section 4.18.2.1, I have shown how to plot transition dipole moment density in real space,
which is extremely useful for studying contribution of different regions in three-dimension space.
In fact, if using a special plotting script of VMD (http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/) provided
below, transition dipole moments contributed by molecular fragments can be easily drawn as arrows,
which greatly facilitates discussion of composition of total transition dipole moment.
Here, azobenzene is taken as example. The input file of TDDFT task of Gaussian for
azobenzene is provided as examples\excit\Azobenzene.gjf. Note that IOp(9/40=4) is used and .chk
file is saved after calculation. Run it by Gaussian, and then convert azobenzene.chk to
azobenzene.fch. (If you do not have Gaussian in hand, you can also directly download the .out
and .fch files from http://sobereva.com/multiwfn/extrafiles/Azobenzene_exc.zip)
Boot up Multiwfn, load the azobenzene.fch, then input
18 // Electron excitation analysis
11 // Decompose transition dipole moment as basis function and atom contributions
Azobenzene.out // The Gaussian output file obtained by running Azobenzene.gjf
2 // Assume that we want to study is electron excitation from ground state to excited state 2
(you can also input two indices to study transition between the two excited states)
1 // The type of transition dipole moment to be decomposed is electric
n // Do not generate AAtrdip.txt, which is not involved in the present example
Now trdipcontri.txt is outputted to current folder, which contains transition dipole moment
contributed by each basis function and each atom. Move this file to VMD folder.
Return to main menu, then enter subfunction 2 of main function 100, export current molecular
geometry to azobenzene.pdb.
Copy examples\excit\loadip.tcl to VMD folder, this is a VMD script written by me, it can load
data from trdipcontri.txt. It also defines custom commands "dip" and "dipatm" used to draw
transition dipole moment contributed by specific molecular fragment as arrow.
Boot up VMD, drag the file azobenzene.pdb into VMD main window to load it, then run source
loaddip.tcl in VMD console window to execute the script. Assume that we want to divide the
molecule as three parts to separately investigate their contributions to transition dipole moment,
namely the first phenyl group (atoms 1~11), N2 part (atoms 12 and 13) and the second phenyl group
(atoms 14~24), we should run below commands in VMD console window
draw color red
dip "serial 1 to 11"
dip "serial 12 13"
dip "serial 14 to 24"

Now you will see three red arrows in the VMD graphical window. The length of cylindrical part of
the arrows correspond to magnitude of fragmental transition dipole moments, the center of the

819

--- page break ---

4 Tutorials and Examples
arrows corresponds to geometric center of the fragments. Note that when we use "dip" command,
the fragment geometry center and quantitative contribution to transition dipole moment by the
selected fragment are also shown in VMD console window.
BTW: It does not matter if the serial of the atoms of your interest is not contiguous. For example, dip "serial 1
5 to 8 11 to 14 18" will plot the transition dipole moment for the fragment consisting of atoms 1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 12,
13, 14, 18.

In order to improve the graphical quality, we input color Display Background white in console
window to set white as background color, enter Graphics - Representation and set Drawing method
to CPK, and then choose Display - Orthographic in VMD main window. The final graph will look
like below.

As you can see, both the two phenyl groups have significant contribution to Y component of
total transition dipole moment (the red, green and blue of the axis shown at left-bottom part of the
graph correspond to X, Y and Z directions, respectively). For quantitative comparison purpose, total
transition dipole moment vector and its compositions are also listed below
Total：

0.1155

-2.8868

0.0

Phenyl group 1：0.14262 -1.43288 0.0
N2：

-0.16948 -0.02138 0.0

Phenyl group 2：0.14262 -1.43288 0.0

If you also want to plot total transition dipole moment as green arrow on the graph, you can
input draw color green and then input dip all.
It is also possible to plot transition dipole moment contributed by each atom. To do that, we
input draw delete all to remove all existing arrows, and then input dipatm, you will immediately see

There is a very important point that should be paid attention to when using above method to
decompose transition dipole moment, namely contribution of a fragment is often dependent of
choice of origin, because transition charge of a fragment is often non-zero. For example, if we use
subfunction 6 of hole-electron analysis module to export atomic transition charges and then sum
them as fragment transition charges, you will find the value of the first phenyl group is 0.2116. Since
it is non-zero, it can be proved that if overall coordinate of the azobenzene is translated, the transition
dipole moment corresponding to this fragment must be varied; in other words, the result is not
definite. Therefore, one should carefully discuss fragmental transition dipole moment in papers.
Another very important point is that since the transition dipole moment is decomposed via
Mulliken method, the analysis method shown above will be meaningless when diffuse functions are
presented in the electron excitation calculation.

4.18.13 Study electronic structure of a single excited state and
difference between two excited states
Most other subsections in Section 4.18 focus on exemplifying how to study electron transition
characters, however, sometimes we want to study character of a single excited state or difference
between two excited states in specific property. In Multiwfn, one can perform various kinds of
wavefunction analysis for an excited state as usual, however, the input file must contain
wavefunction of this excited state. For multi-configuration methods that can study excited state,
such as CIS and TDDFT, the excited state wavefunction must be recorded as natural orbitals (NOs),
because Multiwfn always load wavefunction in terms of orbitals.
The main purpose of this section is illustrating the function used to generate .mwfn file
containing NOs of an excited state, so that we can analyze wavefunction character of this state. I
strongly suggest you read Section 3.21.13 first, in which the details of generating NOs of excited
states are described.
NOTE: There are two types of CIS/TDHF/TDA-DFT/TDDFT excited state wavefunction (or
density matrix): (1) Unrelaxed density (2) Relaxed density. The difference has been detailed
described in Section 3.21.1.1. Briefly speaking, the former is not as real as the latter, but generating
the latter requires additional cost (much higher than simply evaluating excitation energy). Next, I

821

4 Tutorials and Examples
will first illustrate how to perform wavefunction analysis for an excited state and study difference
between two excited states based on unrelaxed density, while at final part of this section I will also
exemplify how to analyze excited state based on its relaxed density.
Example of wavefunction analysis of an excited state (based on unrelaxed density)
Here I take N-phenylpyrrole as example, assume that we want to examine Mayer bond orders
for the second singlet excited state. To do so, we first carry out a regular TDDFT calculation with
IOp(9/40=4) keyword, the examples\excit\N-phenylpyrrole.out is output file and examples\excit\Nphenylpyrrole.fch is corresponding .fch file. The geometry was previously optimized for ground
state.
Boot up Multiwfn and input below commands
examples\excit\N-phenylpyrrole.fch
18 // Electron excitation analysis
13 // Generate natural orbitals of specific excited states
examples\excit\N-phenylpyrrole.out
2 // Choose the 2nd excited state
Now, NO_0002.mwfn has been generated in current folder, it records wavefunction of the
second excited state in terms of NOs.
Reboot Multiwfn and input
NO_0002.mwfn
9 // Bond order analysis
1 // Mayer bond order
From the output you will find the bond order of the N5-C10 bond, namely the bond linking
pyrrole and benzene moieties, is 0.794. If you repeat the calculation for examples\excit\Nphenylpyrrole.fch, the result will correspond to ground state, and you will find the Mayer bond order
is 0.713. Clearly, the vertical excitation from S0 to S2 at minimum point of S0 weakens the strength
of N5-C10 detectably.
Plotting density difference between excited states
Next I illustrate how to plot density difference between various excited state (corresponding to
unrelaxed density). In fact this is very easy, you simply need to generate Multiwfn input files
containing NOs of the two excited states respectively, and then get their difference via the steps
illustrated in Sections 4.5.5 or 4.18.3.
I still take N-phenylpyrrole as example. We repeat aforementioned steps using the Nphenylpyrrole.fch and N-phenylpyrrole.out to generate .mwfn files, when Multiwfn asks you to
input the index of excited states, we input 1-3, then NO_0001.mwfn, NO_0002.mwfn and
NO_0003.mwfn will be generated in current folder, clearly now we can study density difference
between 1-2, 1-3 and 2-3.
Assume that currently we want to visualize isosurface map of electron density difference
between the third and the first excited state, we reboot Multiwfn and input
NO_0003.mwfn
5 // Calculate grid data
0 // Custom operation
1 // One file will be dealt with the firstly loaded file
-,NO_0001.mwfn
1 // Electron density

822

--- page break ---

4 Tutorials and Examples
2 // Medium quality grid
-1 // Visualize isosurface
After setting isovalue to 0.005, we will obtain below graph

The density difference map between other excited states can be obtained similarly.
Although you can also directly use your quantum chemistry program to generate wavefunction
file containing NOs for various excited states, the procedure is evidently much more cumbersome
than using Multiwfn, because as shown above, the advantage of Multiwfn is that it is able to
simultaneously generate .mwfn file containing NOs for a batch of excited states.
Calculate difference in fragment charge between excited states
Next, as an example, we will study difference of electron distribution at quantitative level by
comparing fragment charge of the pyrrole ring between excited states 3 and 1.
Boot up Multiwfn and input
NO_0003.mwfn
7 // Population analysis
-1 // Define fragment
1-9 // The pyrrole fragment, which is composed of atoms 1~9
11 // ADCH charge
1 // Use built-in atomic densities
You will find
Fragment charge:

0.54421290

Namely the fragment charge of the pyrrole ring is 0.544 at the 3rd excited state. Repeat the
calculation for the NO_0001.mwfn, the charge of the pyrrole ring will be found to be 0.117. The
data shows that during the (hypothetical) transition from the 1st to the 3rd excited state, the pyrrole
fragment will lose 0.544−0.117=0.43 electron, this well explains why in the corresponding density
difference map there are obvious isosurfaces around the pyrrole ring and most of them are in blue
color. Do not forget that the current result still corresponds to unrelaxed excited state density.
Wavefunction analysis of an excited state (based on relaxed density)
At final part of this section, I show how to carry out wavefunction analysis for an excited state
based on its relaxed density. N-phenylpyrrole is still taken as example.
We prepare a Gaussian input file with below content. The full file has been provided as

823

--- page break ---

4 Tutorials and Examples
examples\excit\ N-phenylpyrrole_relaxS2.gjf.
%chk=C:\N-phenylpyrrole_relaxS2.chk
# TD(nstates=5,root=2) cam-b3lyp/6-31+g(d) density
...[ignored]

Run this file by Gaussian, then the density matrix corresponding to relaxed density of the 2nd
excited state will be written into the N-phenylpyrrole_relaxS2.chk. Then use formchk utility to
convert it to N-phenylpyrrole_relaxS2.fch (which can also be directly downloaded from
http://sobereva.com/multiwfn/extrafiles/N-phenylpyrrole_relaxS2.zip).
We first need to transform the density matrix to NOs. Boot up Multiwfn and input
N-phenylpyrrole_relaxS2.fch
200 // Other functions, part 2
16 // Generate NOs based on the density matrix in .fch/.fchk
CI // The label of TDDFT density matrix in the file is “CI”
y // Export new.mwfn in current folder and then automatically load it, which contains the newly
generated NOs
Now the orbitals in memory have corresponded to the NOs generated based on the relaxed
density of the 2nd excited state, then we can do arbitrary wavefunction analysis, for example
0 // Return to main menu
9 // Bond order analysis
1 // Mayer bond order
From the output you can find the bond order of the N5-C10 is 0.756, while as shown earlier,
this value corresponding to unrelaxed density is 0.794. The small difference implies that the analysis
result based on unrelaxed density is at least qualitatively correct and as useful as those derived based
on the accurate but expensive relaxed density.
It is also possible to calculate density difference based on relaxed density between two excited
states. You need to repeat above steps twice to respectively generate .mwfn file for two different
excited states, and then get density difference as usual based on the two .mwfn files.
For Gaussian users, in fact one can use such as “# PBE1PBE/6-31G* out=wfn TD(root=x)” keywords to export
NOs of excited state x to specific .wfn file, which can also be employed as input file for performing wavefunction
analysis of the excited state. However, do not forget that many functions in Multiwfn require basis function
information, which cannot be provided by .wfn file, thus in this case the kind of analyses can used is severely limited.
In addition, by solely using Gaussian it is also possible to yield and store the NOs to .fch file, as explicitly described
at the beginning of Chapter 4, however this procedure is relatively cumbersome. Notice that the NOs generated in
these ways correspond to relaxed excited state wavefunction. If you only need the NOs corresponding to the
unrelaxed excited state wavefunction, simply adding “density=rhoci” keyword in route section.

4.18.16 Plot charge-transfer spectrum and calculate major characters
of all excited states: N-phenylpyrrole as an instance
Chinese version of this section is my blog article “Using Multiwfn to plot charge transfer spectrum (CTS) to
intuitively analyze intrinsic characteristics of electronic spectrum” (http://sobereva.com/628), which also contains
extended discussions.

If you are not familiar with IFCT analysis, please check Section 3.21.8 first to gain basic
knowledge and follow Section 4.18.8 to better understand IFCT analysis via a practical example.
The so-called charge-transfer spectrum (CTS), which was defined on the top of IFCT analysis, has
been introduced in Section 4.21.16, please read it first before following the present example. If CTS

is involved in your work, please cite Carbon, 187, 78 (2022) DOI: 10.1016/j.carbon.2021.11.005,
in which I proposed CTS first time and introduced it in supplemental information.
In this section, I will exemplify how to calculate IFCT data for all excited states so that you
can easily identify their major characters, then I will also illustrate how to plot CTS, which is able
to intuitively reveal the nature of various peaks of UV-Vis spectrum.
The N-phenylpyrrole will be employed as an instance, five excited states were calculated by
Gaussian using TDDFT at CAM-B3LYP/6-31+G(d) level. Note that IOp(9/40=4) keyword has been
employed in the calculation. In this study, the phenyl group and the pyrrole group will be defined
as two respective fragments, so that we can identify nature of the excited states from perspective of
intrafragment electron redistribution and interfragment electron transfer.

Calculate IFCT data for all excited states
Boot up Multiwfn and input
examples\excit\N-phenylpyrrole.fch // Produced by TDDFT task of Gaussian
18 // Electron excitation analysis
16 // Calculate charge-transfer spectrum and characters of all excited states
2 // Define two fragments
1-9 // Fragment 1, namely the pyrrole moiety
10-20 // Fragment 2, namely the phenyl moiety
[Press ENTER button directly] // Load examples\excit\N-phenylpyrrole.out, which is output
file of Gaussian TDDFT task
2 // Hirshfeld partition (because diffuse functions were employed in the TDDFT task,
Mulliken-like partition should not be used here)
Then Multiwfn starts to calculate IFCT terms for every excited state in turn, and the resulting
hole and electron distributions are printed on screen. Once the calculation is finished, you will obtain
IFCTdata.txt and IFCTmajor.txt in current folder, and you will also find a new subfolder
"CT_multiple" (This subfolder has been provided in “examples\excit\”).
The content of IFCTdata.txt is shown below. As you can see, it contains detailed IFCT analysis
result for all excited states. The meaning of the terms are easy to understand. For example, hole(1)
and ele(1) correspond to contribution of fragment 1 (pyrrole) to hole and electron distributions,
respectively. redis(1) denotes amount of electron redistribution within fragment 1. 1->2 stands for
amount of electron transfer from fragment 1 to fragment 2.

Since there are lots of data in IFCTdata.txt, it is difficult to quickly identify major characters
of excited states, especially when the number of defined fragments is more than two. Therefore,
Multiwfn also exports IFCTmajor.txt, in which only the IFCT terms with contribution to each
excitation larger than 5% are shown. The content of this file is

As you can see, oscillator strength (f), wavelength (nm) along with major IFCT terms are clearly
shown. Obviously, excited state 5 (S5) mainly shows charge transfer character, while excited state
1 (S1) shows strongly mixed character. Since all other excited states have very small f, they do not
notably contribute to UV-Vis spectrum.
Plot charge-transfer spectrum (CTS)
The charge-transfer spectrum (CTS) proposed by me means decomposing the total UV-Vis
spectrum to individual subspectra respectively contributed by various IFCT terms, and hence the
underlying nature of every noticeable peak can be graphically exhibited. To plot this kind of
spectrum, we reboot Multiwfn and input
CT_multiple\CT_multiple.txt // The list file containing input files for plotting various types of

As can be clearly seen, the peak around 210 nm basically corresponds to pure charge-transfer
excitation, because in this region the "Electron transfer 1->2" curve is close to the black UV-Vis
spectrum curve. The highest peak at approximately 245 nm shows highly hybrid character, both the
two intrafragment electron redistribution curves and the two interfragment electron transfer curves
exhibit comparable heights.
The present example is relatively simple since we only defined two fragments, in fact you can
define arbitrarily number of fragments. For example, if you define three fragments (e.g. respectively
corresponding to D, , A parts of a D--A system), then there will be 9 curves in the CTS, namely:
redis(1), redis(2), redis(3), 1->2, 1->3, 2->3, 1<-2, 1<-3, 2<-3.

4.18.17 Example of performing electron density polarization analysis
based on electron excitations
This section illustrates how to perform the electron density polarization analysis based on
electron excitations, which was proposed in J. Phys. Chem. A, 124, 633 (2020). Please carefully
read Section 3.21.17 first to gain basic knowledge. This section will reproduce the first example in
the J. Phys. Chem. A paper, which employs a point charge of -0.1 e to approximately mimic the
nucleophilic agent at the beginning stage of a SN2 reaction. The molecule that undergoes
nucleophilic attack is CH3Cl. The distance between the point charge and the carbon is arbitrarily set
to be 3 Å. See the following map for illustration.

In this example we use B97XD/def2-TZVP level to perform TDDFT task with 50 excited
states for CH3Cl by Gaussian, the geometry was optimized at B3LYP/def-TZVP level. The Gaussian
input and output files have been provided in “examples\excit\CH3Cl\” folder, the .fch file converted
from the resulting .chk file is provided as CH3Cl.fch. Note that IOp(9/40=4) keyword was used in
the task, the necessity has been emphasized in Section 3.21.A. Since the XYZ coordinate of the
carbon atom is (0.0, 0.0, -1.13395200) Å, according to the above map, evidently the point charge
should be placed at (0.0, 0.0, -4.13395200) Å.
Boot up Multiwfn and input
CH3Cl.fch
18 // Electron excitation analyses
17 // Electron density polarization analysis based on electron excitations
1 // Only one point charge will be set as the external potential
0.0,0.0,-4.13395200,-0.1 // XYZ coordinate (Å) and value (e) of the point charge
2 // Medium quality grid (corresponding to grid spacing of 0.2 Bohr. If you want to reduce
cost, low quality grid can also be used)
[Press ENTER button] // Load the Gaussian output file CH3Cl.out, which is in the same folder
as the CH3Cl.fch
Now Multiwfn starts to calculate data for the 50 excited states in turn, then you will see the
following output:

correspond to E(2) and N, respectively, they have small magnitude because the point charge is small
and not very close to any atom.
We choose option “1 Visualize isosurface of density polarization” to visualize pol and then
change isovalue to 0.0002, you will see the left map in the following figure, in which the green and
blue colors correspond to positive (electron accumulation) and negative (electron depletion) zones,
respectively. For ease of understanding, the position of the placed point charge is automatically
plotted as Bq atom in the map. The pol obtained in this way is approximate. If you want to obtain
rigorous pol (the right map in the following figure), you should use the common method, namely
taking the difference between the electron density obtained with and without a background charge
(please refer to Section 4.5.5 on how to plot electron density map), the wavefunction files generated
with and without the background charge correspond to examples\excit\CH3Cl\bkchg\CH3Cl_Q.fch
and the aforementioned CH3Cl.fch, respectively. It can be seen that the approximate pol and
rigorous pol are in qualitative agreement with each other, indicating that the approximate pol
estimated by means of the perturbation theory is meaningful.

As can be seen in the figure above, there is a region with reduced electron density at the end
of the Cl-C bond axis, so it can be considered that when the nucleophile carrying a local negative
charge that triggers the SN2 reaction approaches the carbon atom, the carbon atom becomes more
electrophilic.
Next, we choose option “2 Visualize isosurface of transition density of an excited state” and
then input 9 to visualize transition density of the 9th electron excitation, which contributes most to

pol. After setting isovalue to 0.004, you will see the following map, in which green and blue colors
represent positive and negative parts, respectively. It can be seen that its distribution is fairly close
to the pol, further confirming that the excitation from ground state to the 9th excited state has the
most crucial contribution to the electron density redistribution in response to the external potential.
It is worth to mention that contribution of the kth electron excitation to the pol is simply 2𝑐𝑘 𝜌0𝑘 ,
where 𝜌0𝑘 is the transition density.

One can better understand the nature of the 9th electron excitation in terms of orbital transition
picture using the NTO analysis, see Section 4.18.6 for example, or simply checking MO maps if
there is a dominant MO transition. If you use the function introduced in Section 3.21.15, you will
find the 9th electron excitation is dominated by (81.7%) the transition from HOMO-2 to LUMO,
their isosurface maps plotted by main function 0 are shown below. It can be seen that HOMO-2
shows bonding character of C-H and C-Cl bonds, while LUMO shows antibonding character of CCl bond. So, we can conclude that the external perturbation by the point charge caused electron
transfer from the bonding orbital to the antibonding orbital, and the C-Cl bond should hence be
weakened. This speculation can be directly confirmed by calculating bond orders. The Mayer and
Laplacian bond orders of the C-Cl bond calculated based on CH3Cl.fch are 1.068 and 0.432,
respectively, while the values calculated for CH3Cl_Q.fch are 1.061 and 0.428, respectively, clearly
indicating that the presence of the point charge detectably lowers the C-Cl bonding strength. As
noted earlier, the point charge is used to mimic the nucleophilic agent at the beginning stage of the
SN2 reaction of CH3Cl, our observation suggests that the electrostatic potential created by the charge
borne by the nucleophile initiates the C-Cl bond breaking.

Finally, if you have interest in the distribution of the external potential, you can choose option
“3 Visualize isosurface of external potential”, you will find the isosurface is spherical and exactly
encloses the point charge.
From this example, we can see that the analysis of electron density polarization in terms of
electron excitations indeed provides valuable and unique insight into the response of a chemical
system to external perturbation. For more application instances and discussions, see J. Phys. Chem.
A, 124, 633 (2020) and J. Comput. Chem., 42, 1118 (2021).
