As can be seen, there are three unoccupied MOs having  composition larger than 50%, while
 compositions of occupied MOs are identical to those we obtained earlier. Now we enter main
function 0 to plot isosurface map for MO27, which is one of unoccupied MOs and has 
compositions of 72.5%. From below map, it is clear that major character of this orbital is indeed .

More discussions and illustrations about analyzing  electron character can be found in my
blog article "Separate investigation of  electronic structure in Multiwfn" (in Chinese,
http://sobereva.com/432).

4.200 Other functions (Part 2)
4.200.4 (moved to Section 4.25.3)
4.200.5 Plot radial distribution function of electron density
Multiwfn is capable of plotting radial distribution function (RDF) for any real space function,
see Section 3.200.5 for detail. This function is particularly useful for studying electronic structure
character of sphere-like system.
This section consists of two parts. In part 1, we will plot RDF for electron density of fullerene
(C60); while in part 2, I will show how to plot RDF of electron density for a Rydberg orbital to
characterize it quantitatively.
Part 1: RDF of electron density for fullerene
Since .wfn file of fullerene at B3LYP/6-31G* level is large, I only provide the corresponding
Gaussian input file for you (C60.gjf in "example" folder), please properly modify and run it by

Gaussian to produce C60.wfn.
Boot up Multiwfn and input:
C60.wfn
200 // Other functions (Part 2)
5 // Plot RDF for a real space function
3
1,6 // Set the lower and upper limit of RDF to 1.0 and 6.0 Å, respectively
0 // Calculate RDF and its integration curve
After the calculation is finished, select option 0, below RDF map will be shown on the screen,
the X-axis corresponds to radial distance

As you can see, the peak of RDF is about 3.5 Å, this is because the distance between nucleus
of carbons and the sphere center is 3.545 Å. It is known that electron density has maximum at
nuclear position for any atom except for hydrogen.
If you carefully examine the RDF curve, you will find that the curve on the right side of the
peak is slightly higher than that on the left sight. The reason is that the amount of  electrons at
outer side of fullerene is richer than inner side. You can also draw and analyze ELF isosurface map
to confirm this point.
You can also choose option 2 to plot integration curve of RDF, as shown below

991

4 Tutorials and Examples

Probably you have noticed that after the calculation there is a prompt on screen:
Integrating the RDF in the specified range is

344.9321931513

which means integrating the RDF from r=1.0 to r=6.0 Å yields 344.932, it also corresponds to the
value of integration curve at r=6.0. This value deviates evidently from our expectation, namely the
number of electrons in current system (360). One reason is that the default number of integration
points is not large enough (500 and 2030 for radial and angular parts, respectively. You can manually
increase them), while another reason is more important, that is the size of the current system is too
large, using single-center integration method is too difficult to yield a very accurate result, at least
for integrating electron density.
Part 2: Using RDF of electron density to quantitatively characterize Rydberg orbital for
acetone
Rydberg orbitals denote the spatially very diffuse MOs, their orbital shapes are akin to atomic
orbitals, since electrons in Rydberg orbitals can be regarded as weakly bounded by a small cation
core, which behaves as an atomic nucleus. In order to faithfully represent the diffuse character of
Rydberg orbitals, basis set with substantial diffuse functions must be employed, e.g. aug-cc-pVTZ.
The example file we used below is formaldehyde calculated at B3LYP/aug-cc-pVTZ level by
Gaussian. We will first visualize Rydberg orbitals as isosurfaces, and then calculate RDF of electron
density corresponding to these orbitals to characterize them quantitatively.
Boot up Multiwfn, load examples\H2CO_aVTZ.fch, then enter main function 0. Since Rydberg
orbitals are very diffuse, in order to avoid truncating their isosurfaces when viewing them, you
should first select "Other settings"-"Set extension distance" and input a large value, here we input
12. After that, change isovalue to a much smaller value than default, e.g. 0.01. Then we arbitrarily
select some virtual MOs to examine their features. You will find a lot of virtual MOs show very
diffuse character, for example, MO10 and MO11 are shown below:

The main distribution region of both of them are far from the molecule. MO10 is almost spherically
symmetric, thus is can be denoted as s type of Rydberg orbital. While MO11 has two phases, they
equally distribute at the two sides, the overall shape is very close to atomic p orbitals, therefore
MO11 can be identified as p type of Rydberg orbital.
How to quantitatively demonstrate that the main distribution region of these Rydberg orbitals
is far from the molecular center? One of the best way is plotting RDF of electron density
corresponding to these orbitals. Here we plot this kind of RDF map for MO11. We close the GUI of
main function 0, and then input below commands:
6 // Modify wavefunction
26 // Modify orbital occupation number
0 // Select all orbitals
0 // Select occupation number of all orbitals to zero
11 // Select orbital 11
2 // Set occupation number of orbital 11 to 2.0 (assume it is doubly occupied)
q // Return
-1 // Return to main menu
200
5 // Plot RDF
3 // Set lower and upper limit of radial plotting
0,10 // From 0 to 10 Å
4 // Set angular number of integration points. The default value is unnecessarily high for
present purpose, therefore we set it to a smaller value to reduce computational time
302 // 302 angular points
0 // Calculate RDF for electron density (which is the default real space function)
1 // Plot the RDF map

4 Tutorials and Examples

From the map it can be seen that the global maximum peak is at about 4.6Å, indicating that the
major distribution region of this orbital wavefunction is very far from origin (in present .fch file,
Cartesian origin corresponds to molecular center), and thus MO11 can be unambiguously identified
as a Rydberg orbital.
Please also plot such a RDF map for a regular valence virtual MO, e.g. MO9, which is *
orbital. Where is its peak position?

4.200.6 Studying correspondence between orbitals in different
wavefunction files
In this section, two examples are given to illustrate how to use the function introduced in
Section 3.200.6, this function aims to reveal relationship between orbitals in different wavefunction
files.

4.200.6.1 Revealing relationship between HF and MP2 orbitals of CH3NH2
In this section, we study the correspondence between HF/6-31+G* MOs and MP2/6-31+G*
natural orbitals (NO) for CH3NH2.
After booting up Multiwfn we input
C:\CH3NH2_MP2.wfn // MP2/6-31+G* wavefunction file, there are 48 NOs
200 // Other function, part 2
6 // Analyze correspondence between orbitals in two wavefunctions
[Press ENTER button directly to choose all orbitals]
C:\CH3NH2_HF.wfn // HF/6-31+G* wavefunction file, there are 9 MOs

The first column denotes the index of the MP2 NOs, the largest five contributions from the
Hartree-Fock MOs to them are shown at right side. As can be seen, the first (second) NO is nearly
equivalent to the second (first) MO. While the 9th NO cannot be solely represented by any MO, it
mainly arises from the severe mix of the 7th (53.98%) and 6th MOs (32.07%), the 9th MO also has
nonnegligible contribution (8.76%).
If you want to get all coefficients and compositions of an orbital of present wavefunction (e.g.
the 5th NO), then simply input 5, you will see

4.200.6.2 Study contribution of lone pair of nitrogen to MOs of dopamine
Sometimes it is useful to investigate a problem like "How large is contribution of lone pair of
an heteroatom to a molecular orbital?", using orbital localization technique in combination with
subfunction 6 of main function 200 can provide a clear answer to this problem. In this section, we
will study contribution of lone pair of nitrogen in amino group to occupied MOs for a Donor-acceptor type of molecule. The wavefunction file is examples\excit\D-pi-A.fchk, the structure and
atomic numbering are shown below

We should first generate localized molecular orbitals (LMOs), because commonly a lone pair
can be represented by a LMO.
Boot up Multiwfn and input below commands

1 // Localize occupied orbitals
The LMOs are automatically exported to new.fch in current folder. From the outputted LMO
composition on the screen, we can find there are several LMOs closely related to the N24, namely
the nitrogen in amino group. Below are relevant lines of orbital composition output.

To confirm which one corresponds to lone pair of N24, we enter main function 0 and check
isosurface of the highlighted LMOs one by one, we find LMO 44 can be regarded as lone pair orbital
of N24, the isosurface map with isovalue of 0.1 is shown below

Now we can check contribution of this LMO to various MOs. Reboot Multiwfn and input
examples\excit\D-pi-A.fchk

1,56 // We want to check all occupied MOs (indices range is 1~56)
new.fch // The file containing LMOs
44,44 // Only the 44th orbital in the new.fch will be taken into account
From the output, we can find some MOs have large composition of the LMO 44, relevant lines
are shown below (Since only LMO 44 is taken into account, other LMOs have exactly zero
contribution)

We return to main menu, enter main function 0 and visualize MO 49 to check whether LMO
44 (lone pair of N24) really has large contribution (33.29%) to it. The isosurface map with isovalue
of 0.05 is shown below

As can be seen, indeed MO 44 is largely contributed by lone pair of N24, since a large part of its
isosurface covers the lone pair region of N24, the computed composition 33.29% should be a
reasonable value.

4.200.12 Calculate energy index (EI) and bond polarity index (BPI)
In this section I will illustrate how to calculate EI and BPI indices, which were defined in J.
Phys. Chem., 94, 5602 (1990). If you are not familiar with these two quantities, please read Section
3.200.12 first. The geometry and wavefunction involved in this example were produced at HF/631G* level, which is the one used in above mentioned paper.
We will calculate BPI for C-N bond of CH3NH2, before this we first need to calculate reference
EI value for C and N atoms, which correspond to EI of C in ethane and N in H2N-NH2, respectively.
Boot up Multiwfn and input
examples\EI_BPI\ethane.fch
200 // Other function, part 2
12 // Calculate energy index (EI) or bond polarity index (BPI)
1 // C1 atom
You will see the EI value for C in reference molecule ethane is -0.667639 a.u.
Reboot Multiwfn and input
examples\EI_BPI\N2H4.fch
200 // Other function, part 2
12 // Calculate EI or BPI
1 // N1 atom
You can see the EI value for N in reference molecule H2N-NH2 is -0.718126 a.u.
Next we calculate EI for C and N in CH3NH2. Reboot Multiwfn and input
examples\EI_BPI\CH3NH2.fch
200 // Other function, part 2

997

--- page break ---

4 Tutorials and Examples
12 // Calculate EI or BPI
1 // C1, the result is -0.693374 a.u.
5 // N5, the result is -0.698092 a.u.
The BPICN in CH3NH2.is computed as

BPI CN = (EI C − EI Cref ) − (EI N − EI ref
N )
= −0.693374 + 0.667639 + 0.698092 − 0.718126
= −0.046
As a comparison, use examples\EI_BPI\F2.fch to calculate reference value for F, the result
should be -0.992542 a.u., and use examples\EI_BPI\CH3F.fch to calculate EI for C and F in CH3F
molecule, the result should be -0.750302 and -0.885961, respectively. Then compute the BPICF value
as -0.750302+0.667639+0.885961-0.992542= -0.189. Since BPICF in CH3F is evidently more
negative than BPICN in CH3NH2, it can be concluded that C-F bond in CH3F is more polar than CN bond in CH3NH2.
Via EI index we can also evaluate the so-called group electronegativity, which is often more
useful than atomic electronegativity. Here we calculate electronegativity for -CH3 group, which is
simply the negative of EIC for CH3 radical. Boot up Multiwfn and input
examples\EI_BPI\CH3.fch // Optimized and produced at UHF/6-31G*
200 // Other function, part 2
12 // Calculate EI or BPI
1 // Carbon atom
The result is -0.630656 a.u., corresponding to electronegativity of CH3 group of 0.631. Then
we use examples\EI_BPI\F.fch to calculate group electronegativity for -F, the result is 0.957. It is
clear that -F group has much higher electronegativity, and thus has stronger capacity to attract
electrons than -CH3 group due to its lower average energy per valence electron.

4.200.13 Study orbital contributions to density difference
Note: Chinese version of this section is my blog article “Using Multiwfn to study contribution of molecular
orbital, NBO and so on to density difference and Fukui function” (http://sobereva.com/502).

In this section, I will use a few examples to illustrate how to derive contributions of various
kinds of orbitals to density difference () of different types, and show which chemically valuable
information could be obtained by means of these analyses. Please read Section 3.200.13 first to gain
basic knowledge about the function employed in this section.

4.200.13.1 Contribution of MOs to Fukui function f − of phenol
The basic concept of Fukui function has been detailedly introduced in Section 4.5.4. The Fukui
function f − is frequently employed in literatures to identify favourable sites of electrophilic attack,
it is a special instance of  and is defined as 𝜌𝑁 (𝐫) − 𝜌𝑁−1 (𝐫), where N is the number of electrons
in original state. It is interesting to study relative contribution of various MOs to the f −, so that we
can better recognize its character from orbital point of view. The underlying idea is that if densities
of MOs are regarded as basis functions that can be used to linearly expand f −, then the optimal
expansion coefficients will be able to be used to measure contribution of each MO to the f −.

4 Tutorials and Examples
Evidently, if there is no orbital relaxation effect, the f − must be exactly identical to probability
density of HOMO of N-state. Of course this assumption is not true, because in practice all MOs of
N-state must somewhat undergo deformation when the number of electrons changes from N to N-1.
Below we will take phenol as example to illustrate how to calculate contribution of all occupied
MOs to f −. The files carrying orbital wavefunctions of N and N-1 states have been provided as
phenol.wfn and phenol_N-1.wfn in "examples" folder, respectively. Before calculation of the
contribution, we first need to generate cube file of f −. To do so, boot up Multiwfn and input
examples\phenol.wfn // Wavefunction file of N-state
5 // Calculate grid data
0 // Set custom operation
1 // Only one file will be operated with the file that has been loaded
-,examples\phenol_N-1.wfn
1 // Electron density
2 // Medium quality grid
2 // Export the grid data as density.cub in current folder
Now, we can directly enter the function used to derive orbital contributions to . Input below
commands
0 // Return to main menu
200 // Other functions (Part 2)
13 // Evaluate orbital contributions to density difference or other grid data
density.cub // The file containing grid data of f −
0 // Choose orbital range and start analysis
o // Only consider orbitals with non-zero occupation in the fitting. For present case all occupied
MOs are chosen (note that the wavefunction file we loaded is in .wfn format, in fact it only contains
occupied orbitals, thus unoccupied orbitals cannot be chosen even if you want)
Soon the contribution values are listed in ascending order:

Sum of all values:

Fitting error (definition 1):

0.8911

Fitting error (definition 2):

0.003828

Because by default the sum of all contributions is constrained to 1.0, the "Sum of all values" is
exactly 1.0. The default constraint makes sense for present case, since N and N-1 just differ by 1
electron. The "Fitting error" displays the fitting quality. The smaller the fitting error, the better the
fitting quality. However, the best way of examining the fitting quality is visually comparing the
isosurface of the actual  and the fitted . From above data, it can be clearly seen that MO25
(HOMO) dominates the f −, while MO24 (HOMO-1) and MO23 (HOMO-2) also play nonnegligible
roles.
In the post-processing menu, we can choose options 2 and 3 to visualize isosurface of provided

grid data (i.e. the one loaded from density.cub) and that of fitted grid data, respectively. The
difference between the two set of grid data can be visualized via option 4. The corresponding graphs
are given below, the isovalue is set to 0.005. For comparison purpose, the three MOs having largest
contributions are also given below, the isovalue is 0.07, and the contribution values are marked in
the parentheses.

From above map, it can be seen that our fitted grid data is very close to the provided one, at
least the fitted one is able to reasonably reproduce the basic character in  region. The main
difference between the provided and the fitted grid data is the  region, as clearly reflected in the
"diff" subgraph. This observation implies that loss of an electron causes severe relaxation of 
electrons, which cannot be fully represented based on the occupied MOs of N-state.
The MO23, MO24 and MO25 shown in above map are all  orbitals, this fact explains why
the  part of the f − cannot be faithfully represented in the fitted grid data. Notice that a few MOs
have negative contributions, the one with most negative value is MO20 (-0.108). If you check this
orbital, you will find it is an  orbital. However, since its shape is not quite similar to the "diff" grid
data, its existence does not improve the fitting quality or lower the difference between the provided
and fitted grid data.
From above map we can also find the profile of isosurface of MO25 is very similar to the f −,
this is why MO25 has dominant contribution and also why f − can often be reasonably approximated
by HOMO distribution. It is obvious that if there is no orbital relaxation effect, contribution of
MO25 should be exactly 1.0 while all other MOs should have contribution of 0.0.
It is worth to stress that the range of the orbital considered in the fitting affects the resulting contributions. For
example, you only want to calculate contribution of MOs 10~15, you will find their contributions are different when
MOs 1~15 are chosen and when MOs 10~15 are chosen.

4.200.13.2 Contribution of NBO orbitals to Fukui function f − of 1,3-butadiene
This time we calculate contribution of various highly occupied NBOs to f − of 1,3-butadiene.
The .fch file of N and N-1 states, as well as NBO plot files .31 and .37 generated for N state have
been provided in "examples\orb_densdiff\butadiene" folder. The geometry has been optimized for
N-state.

Note that the NBO orbitals recorded in the .37 file can be divided as two categories, the Lewis
type and Rydberg type. The Lewis NBOs have occupation number of approximately 2.0 while the
Rydberg ones are almost unoccupied. Since only the Lewis NBOs significantly contribute to
electron density of N-state, we will only take these orbitals into account.
First, we generate cube file of f − type of Fukui function. Boot up Multiwfn and input
examples\orb_densdiff\butadiene\butadiene.fch

2 // Export the grid data as density.cub in current folder
Now reboot Multiwfn and input
examples\orb_densdiff\butadiene\BUTADIENE.31
37 // Load the BUTADIENE.37 in the same folder, which records NBO orbitals
Now if you enter main function 6 and choose option 3 to examine orbital information, you will
find the first 15 orbitals correspond to Lewis type of NBOs due to their high occupation numbers.
Next, we input below commands in the main menu
200 // Other functions (Part 2)

The data clearly shows that NBO4 and NBO9 equally and fully dominate the f −, while
participation of other orbitals can be safely ignored.

(isovalue=0.1) of NBO4 and NBO9 are collectively shown below

Since from the graph it is obvious that NBO4 and NBO9 correspond to  bond of C1-C4 and
C6-C8, respectively, and the fitted function is qualitatively consistent with the provided f −, we can
conclude that the f − is mainly composed of the  electrons over the C1-C4 and C6-C8 bonds.

4.200.13.3 Contribution of NBO orbitals to density difference between S0
and S1 states of H2CO
Finally, we study contribution of NBOs to  between S1 and S0 states of H2CO.
All relevant files used in this section have been provided in "examples\orb_densdiff\H2CO"
folder, including the NBO plot files generated for ground state, wavefunction file of ground state
(S0.fch) and wavefunction of the first excited state (S1.wfn). The Gaussian input files used for
generating these files are also provided.
We first generate the  between S1 and S0 states. Boot up Multiwfn and input

It can be seen that the NBO having dominant positive value is NBO32. The NBO having the
most negative contribution is NBO8, its magnitude of negative contribution is by far greater than
any other NBO. From the "Natural Bond Orbitals (Summary)" field printed by NBO module in the
Gaussian output file examples\orb_densdiff\H2CO\S0.out, it can be seen that the NBO8 is identified
as " LP ( 2) O 3", namely lone pair of O3.
The isosurface of fitted  (isovalue=0.03) as well as isosurface of NBO8 and NBO32 (both
isovalues are set to 0.17) are shown below.

By comparing the "fitted" graph with the S0→S1 graph shown earlier, it is apparent that the
fitted  is almost completely identical to the rigorously calculated one, hence the fitting quality in

the current instance is fairly high and the contribution values must be very reliable and meaningful.
From the orbital isosurface maps it is obvious that the NBO8 indeed corresponds to lone pair of O3,
while NBO32 corresponds to anti- orbital of C1-O3, therefore the S0→S1 excitation could be
unambiguously identified as n(O3)→*(C1-O3) type of transition.
You can also calculate contribution of various NAOs to the S0→S1 excitation, the only
difference from the above example is that after loading the H2CO.31, you should input 33 to load
the H2CO.33, which records NAO orbitals. You will find the S0→S1 excitation mainly involves
transitions from highly occupied p type NAOs to those nearly unoccupied.

4.200.14 Domain analysis examples
The domain analysis refers to quantitative analysis for the region enclosed by isosurface of
given real space function, see Section 3.200.14 for details. To illustrate the powerfulness and flexible
of the domain analysis module, some practical applications of the domain analysis are given below.

4.200.14.1 Integrate real space functions within reduced density gradient
(RDG) isosurface to study weak interaction quantitatively
Before reading this, please read Section 3.23.1 to understand how to use reduced density
gradient (RDG) to reveal weak interaction regions. In this section, I show the possibility of
characterizing weak interaction by integrating domains enclosed by RDG isosurfaces.
System 1: Phenol dimer
First, we use phenol dimer as example. Boot up Multiwfn and input
examples\phenoldimer.wfn
200 // Other functions (Part 2)
14 // Integrate real space functions within isosurfaces of a real space function
Here we want to study RDG domains defined as regions enclosed by isosurface of RDG = 0.5;
in other words, these domains composed of grid points where RDG < 0.5. Therefore, we select
option 2 and choose "13 Reduced density gradient", and then select option 3 and input criterion,
namely <0.5 (In fact, RDG < 0.5 is the default setting and you do not need to manually do these
steps). Next, input below commands:
1 // Start calculation grid data and generate domains
-10 // Adjust extension distance
0 // Set extension distance to zero to avoid wasting of grid points at boundary area, where
RDG isosurfaces commonly do not occur
2 // Medium quality grid (grid spacing=0.1 Bohr), generally this is accurate enough
Now Multiwfn starts calculation of grid data for the selected real space function (i.e. RDG),
and then identifies individual RDG domains according to the criterion of RDG<0.5. Finally, four
domains are found, the number of grid points constituting the domains are shown as the last column:

If you have read Section 3.23.1, you must know these domains correspond to H-bond and van der
waals (vdW) interactions between the two phenols, respectively. We can study properties of these
domains in terms of integrating specific real space functions within corresponding regions. We input
1 // Integrate a domain
2 // Index of the domain of interest
2 // Choose a real space function
1 // Using electron density as integrand
the result is:

0.3102088666E-02

From the output we know the number of electrons involved in the domains corresponding to
H-bond and vdW interactions are 0.006933 and 0.011817, respectively. They can be interpreted as
overlapping electrons and are closely related to strength of same type of interactions. However,
since these two domains correspond to different types of weak interactions, the magnitude of
overlapping electrons is not positively correlated to their strengths, namely we are unable thus to
conclude that the vdW interaction between the two phenols is stronger than the intermolecular Hbond. The "Volume" in the output denotes volume of the domain, we can find that vdW interaction
involves much wider spatial region than H-bond. "Average" corresponds to average value of real
space function in the domain, from this quantity one can easily infer that the strength of interaction
per contact region of H-bond must be significantly higher than that of vdW interaction, since as
shown above, their average values are 0.0239 and 0.0045, respectively, the former is much larger
than the latter.
System 2: 2-pyridoxine 2-aminopyridine
Intermolecular H-bonds of 2-pyridoxine 2-aminopyridine (PP) has been investigated in Section
4.2.1 by means of AIM analysis, while this time we will analyze them by means of qint index. This
index was proposed in J. Phys. Chem. A, 115, 12983 (2011) for judging interaction of H-bond at
various intermolecular distance, please check Section 3.200.14 for its definition. Commonly, the
more negative of the qint index, the more stable the interaction.
qint index is defined based on integrating domains enclosed by RDG = 0.6 isosurfaces, therefore

we need to first calculate RDG grid data and generate corresponding domains. Note that it is not
always appropriate to set extension distance of RDG grid data to zero. For present system, if you
calculate RDG grid data by main function 5 with extension distance of zero, you will see some RDG
isosurfaces are truncated by box boundary, as shown below and highlighted by red arrows. In this
case domain integrating module of Multiwfn does not work.

Therefore, when we calculate RDG grid data for this case, extension distance should be set
somewhat larger than zero, 3 Bohr is safe enough for avoiding unexpected truncation. Extension
distance should also never be set to a too large value, otherwise the number of grid points to be
calculated will be very high and thus very time-consuming.
Boot up Multiwfn and input below commands:
examples\2-pyridoxine_2-aminopyridine.wfn
200 // Other functions (Part 2)
14 // Integrate real space functions within isosurfaces of a real space function
3 // Change the default criterion of defining domain
<0.6
1 // Start calculation of grid data
-10 // Change extension distance
3 // 3.0 Bohr of extension distance
2 // Medium quality grid
Now visualize resulting domains. Domains 2 and 4 are shown below, clearly they correspond
to H-bond of N23-H25O1 and N2-H12N13, respectively.

Next, select option "5 Calculate q_bind index for a domain" and input 2, then press ENTER
button directly to use 4/3 as the integrand (which was used in J. Phys. Chem. A, 115, 12983 (2011)),

N23-H25O1 (-0.004854), the former should be stronger than the latter.
Since both the interactions are H-bond, it is also possible to simply compare the number of
electrons contained in the domains to estimate their relative strength. We choose "2 Perform
integration for all domains", then input 2, and then select electron density as integrand to obtain

Not only the integration value of domain 2 (0.01648) is evidently smaller than domain 4
(0.02618), but also the average value of domain 2 (0.02706) is smaller than domain 4 (0.03285),
therefore we have strong evidence to say N2-H12N13 is stronger than N23-H25O1.
With similar steps illustrated in this section, you can also integrate other real space functions
such as potential energy density and spin density in the domains enclosed by isosurfaces of other
real space functions, e.g. IRI, ginter and ELF.
Note that the accuracy of integration in the domains is directly determined by grid setting,
higher quality of grid leads to better accuracy. For example, when visualizing domains, if you found
a domain only consists of very few grid points, and its profile is very coarse, then integration
accuracy of this domain must be very low.

4.200.14.2 Visualize molecular cavity and calculate its volume by domain
analysis module
This is an application instance of domain analysis module, I will briefly illustrate how to use
Multiwfn to visualize molecular cavity and calculate cavity volume. More examples and

cavity and calculate cavity volume” (http://sobereva.com/408, in Chinese).
The idea of using domain analysis to study molecular cavity is very simple: We first calculate
promolecular density, then we define the regions having electron density lower than a threshold e.g.
0.0001 as molecular cavity. More than one such regions may exist, the domain analysis module
automatically assigns them with different domain indices. After that, by visualizing the domains, it
should be easy to find the domain corresponding to the molecular cavity. The choice of threshold is
somewhat arbitrary, commonly 0.001~0.0001 a.u. is appropriate.
-cyclodextrin is used as an example in this section. Before studying the cavity using domain
analysis module, it is suggested to first visualize promolecular density under various isovalues. Boot
up Multiwfn and input:
examples\alpha-cyclodextrin.pdb
5 // Calculate grid data
1 // Promolecular density
-10 // Set extension distance
0 // Zero extension distance, namely let the box just enclose the molecule
1 // Low quality grid
-1 // Show isosurface map
Click "Show data range" in the GUI window to show the box of grid data as blue frame, and
set isovalue to 0.01 and 0.001 respectively, you will see

It is easy to understand, if we use threshold of 0.001 a.u., then the domain corresponding to the
cavity in the center of the molecule cannot be defined, because the internal region and external
region are connected via the three channels pointed by red arrows. While in the case of 0.0001 a.u.,
the molecular cavity is clearly identifiable and thus we could use domain analysis module with this
threshold to study the cavity.
Return to main menu, and then input below commands
200 // Other functions (Part 2)
14 // Domain analysis
2 // Choose the real space function to be calculated and used for partitioning domains
1 // Promolecular density
3 // Define the rule of determining domains

Then we can visualize each domain by option 3. After examining the domains, we find that the
domain with index of 4 is the one corresponding to molecular cavity, as shown below:

Since this domain well represents shape of actual molecular cavity, its volume is a good indicator
of cavity size. As shown earlier, its volume is 47.0 Å3.
Close the GUI, select option 1 to carry out integration within domain, and input 4 to choose to
integrate the domain corresponding to the cavity. We choose "100 User-defined real space function"
as integrand (by default, this function is 1.0 everywhere and thus does not take any computational
cost), then below information is printed on screen

The integration result directly corresponds to the volume of the domain (47.0 Å3) since the current
integrand is 1.0 everywhere, from the output we also find the span distance of the domain, in Z
direction the value is 7.09 Å, which is the difference between the points in the domain with
maximum Z and with minimum Z coordinates. So, using Multiwfn we can not only obtain cavity
volume but also obtain cavity span distance.
Furthermore, we can export a selected domain as domain.cub in current folder by using option
10, so that the domain can be portrayed as isosurface in third-part visualization tools, such as VMD.
In the resulting domain.cub, the grids within the selected domain have value of 1, while grids in
other regions (as well as boundary grids) have value of 0, therefore isosurface of domain can be
rendered with isovalue between 0 and 1 (commonly 0.5 is used). We do this for the domain 4 and
plot it as isosurface in VMD, below graph will be obtained

We can also use option 11 to export boundary grids of a domain to domain.pdb, in which each
particle corresponds to a boundary grid. You can load this file into VMD and render the particles as
points. Then if you want to measure domain, you can click keyboard button 2, then click two points
in the graphical window, the linking line will appear and the distance will be labelled, as illustrated

4.200.14.3 Integrate electron density difference in its isosurfaces
In this section, we integrate electron density difference (EDD) in its isosurfaces. Specifically,
the EDD in this section corresponds to deformation density (def), see Section 3.7.2 for its
definition. Benzene is taken as instance.
The .cub file of EDD for benzene (benzene_EDD.cub) has been provided at
http://sobereva.com/multiwfn/extrafiles/benzene_EDD.zip. You can also easily generate it using
main function 5. We first examine its isosurface map. Boot up Multiwfn and load benzene_EDD.cub,
then enter main function 0, set isovalue to 0.015, you will see the following map. The green and
blue isosurfaces correspond to positive and negative parts, respectively, which correspond to
electron density increase and decrease regions due to formation of benzene from isolated atoms. In
this example, we will use domain analysis module to respectively integrate the EDD within the two
domains indicated by the red and blue circles.

Return to main menu, and then input

Then we integrate EDD in the domain 3. Close the GUI window and input
1 // Perform integration for a domain
3 // Domain index is 3
1 // The integrand is just the grid data in memory, namely EDD
The result is -0.032 a.u.
Next, we integrate EDD in the green isosurface mentioned earlier. Input:
0 // Exit domain analysis module
14 // Domain analysis
3 // Set criterion for defining domain
>0.015
-1 // Yield domains based on the grid data in memory
After visually checking, we find domain 14 corresponds to the isosurface of interest, as shown
below

Close the GUI window and input
1 // Perform integration for a domain
14 // Domain index is 14

The result is 0.156 a.u.
Finally, it is worth to emphasize that because the integral is evaluated numerically based on
uniform grids, the smaller the grid spacing, the better the integration accuracy.
You can similarly integrate other kinds of EDD, including Fukui function and dual descriptor.

4.200.18 Studying bond length/order alternation (BLA/BOA) as well as
alteration of bond angle and dihedral for specific paths
Note: Chinese version of this section is my blog article “Using Multiwfn to calculate bond length/order
alternation (BLA/BOA) and study variation of bond length, bond order and angle with respect to bond index”
(http://sobereva.com/501), which contains more discussion.

The basic knowledge about definition and calculation of bond length alternation (BLA) and
bond order alternation (BOA) have been introduced in Section 3.200.18. Multiwfn can not only
calculate BLA and BOA, but can also calculate variation of bond length, bond order, bond angle
and dihedral along a given path. This function is quite useful in studying characteristics of
conjugated chains. In this section two examples will be given.
In this function, any file format that carries geometry information can be used as input file,
such as .xyz, .pdb and .mol. However, if you also want to study BOA, the input file must contain
basis function information, such as .mwfn, .fch, .molden or .gms.

4.200.18.1 BLA and BOA of thiophene oligomer
In this section, we will calculate BLA and BOA for a thiophene oligomer with 5 repeat units,
the .fchk file generated at PBE0/6-31G* level can be downloaded here:
http://sobereva.com/multiwfn/extrafiles/TP5.zip. The geometry was optimized at B3LYP/6-31G*
level.
Before calculation, you need to first determine indices of the atoms in the conjugated chain of
interest. The easiest way of doing this is using GaussView. Now we use GaussView (version  6.0)

1013

--- page break ---

4 Tutorials and Examples

to open the TP5.fchk, choose

button in the "Builder" panel, then hold down the left mouse

button and let the cursor pass through each atom in the conjugated chain to select them as yellow.
After that, the image in the GaussView window should like this:

Then enter "Tools" - "Atom Selection", you will find the atom indices of the selected chain is
10,12,14,16-17,19,21,23-24,26,28,30-31,33,35. Also, as can be seen from the above figure, the
index of the atom at the beginning side and ending side is 1 and 35, respectively.
Note: Of course, it is not absolutely necessary to use GaussView for the present function. However, without
GaussView, you have to manually record indices of all atoms in the chain by means of visual inspection, obviously
this process is fairly troublesome!

Now boot up Multiwfn and input
TP5.fchk
200 // Other functions (Part 2)
18 // Calculate bond length/order alternation (BLA/BOA) and study variation of bond
characteristics with respect to bond index
10,12,14,16-17,19,21,23-24,26,28,30-31,33,35 // The indices of the atoms in the chain
1,35 // Index of the atom at the beginning side and ending side
Then Multiwfn automatically identifies the atom sequence of the chain based on your inputted
information. As can be seen from screen, the identified sequence is

18-membered ring. Note that the value range of dihedral (D) is 0~180, the "deviation to planar" is
identical to D if the D is within 0~90, while it corresponds to 180−D if the D is within 90~180.
If you copy the data from screen (see Section 5.4 if you do not know how to do this) and plot
them via external software such as Origin, you can obtain below maps, which very clearly exhibit
geometric characteristics of the ring:

Since bond angles and dihedrals fluctuate evidently along the ring, we can conclude that the ring
undergoes prominent geometry deformation during the molecular dynamics simulation.

4.200.19 Examples of calculating spatial delocalization index
Please read Section 3.200.19 to understand basic knowledge of spatial delocalization index
(SDI). In this example we will calculate SDI for density of orbital wavefunctions to characterize
spatial delocalization extent of various orbitals. SDI can also be applied to quantify spatial
delocalization of any other function, such as spin density.
Note that the ODI described in Section 4.8.5 is also able to compare orbital delocalization
extents; however, definitions of ODI and SDI are different, and SDI is in principle more rigorous
and free of choice of atom partition method.
Calculate SDI based on wavefunction file
As an example, we calculate SDI for densities of all occupied orbitals of examples\excit\D-piA.fchk. Boot up Multiwfn, load this file, and then input
200 // Other function (Part 2)

You can use such as Origin to plot SDI value versus orbital index:

The larger the SDI of an orbital density, the more evident the orbital delocalization character.
From the above map, you can infer that orbital 44 is strongly delocalized (SDI = 15.41 a.u.), while
orbital 33 (SDI = 5.97 a.u.) is highly localized. See below map for comparison. Orbitals from 1 to
16 are evidently core orbitals since they show extreme localization character, as indicated by the
extremely low SDI.

Calculate SDI based on grid data file
To calculate SDI, you can not only provide a file containing wavefunction information as input
file, but can also provide a grid data file (e.g. cube file) containing the function to be studied. As an
example, we calculate SDI based on grid data of density of MO19 of the D-pi-A system, the file can
be downloaded at http://sobereva.com/multiwfn/extrafiles/D-pi-A_MO19_dens.zip. Boot up
Multiwfn and load the cube file in the compressed package, then input
200 // Other function (Part 2)

--- page break ---

4 Tutorials and Examples
19 // Calculating SDI
3 // Calculate SDI based on grid data in memory
Then you will see:
Spatial delocalization index is

6.030145

This result is in good agreement with the SDI of MO19 computed based on examples\excit\D-piA.fchk, which is 6.07.
Sometimes the quantum chemistry or first-principles program that can produce grid data file
cannot generate a wavefunction file that supported by Multiwfn, in this case if you need to calculate
SDI to study orbital delocalization, you have to calculate SDI based on grid data file like this
example.
Multiwfn can also be used to calculate SDI of any other function as long as it is natively
supported by Multiwfn or you can provide a grid data file of that function. For example, if you use
cube file recording spin density as input file and input the same commands like the present example,
then the resulting SDI can be used to characterize spatial extent of delocalization of spin density.

4.200.20 Using bond order density and natural adaptive orbital to study
chemical bonds
Note: Chinese version of this topic is "Using bond order density (BOD) and natural adaptive orbital (NAdO) to
graphically study chemical bonds" (http://sobereva.com/535), which contains much more examples and fuller
discussions.

The theory of bond order density (BOD) and natural adaptive orbital (NAdO) has been
detailedly introduced in Section 3.200.20, please carefully read it first. In this section I will present
two examples to show how to use the BOD and NAdO to study chemical bonds.

4.200.20.1 Plot bond order density for N2 molecule
The delocalization index (DI) represents average number of electron pairs shared by two atoms
and can be regarded as a definition of (covalent) bond order. By plotting BOD, we can better
understand the nature of its value. The integral of the BOD defined for two atoms over the whole
space exactly corresponds to the DI between the two atoms, therefore BOD is able to exhibit local
contributions everywhere to DI.
N2 molecule is taken as example in the present section, we will plot its BOD as color-filled
map in the molecular plane. In Multiwfn, delocalization index (DI) can be calculated based on fuzzy
partition via fuzzy atomic space analysis module (main function 15) or based on atom-in-molecules
(AIM) partition via basin analysis module (main function 17); correspondingly, both the two
modules can export atomic overlap matrix (AOM), which is needed by BOD analysis. In the present
example, we use the former (the latter works equally well but more expensive).
Boot up Multiwfn and input below commands
examples\N2.fch // Optimized and generated at B3LYP/def-TZVP level. You can also use other
files (e.g. .molden and .mwfn) as long as the file contains basis function information
15 // Fuzzy atomic space analysis
3 // Calculate and output atomic overlap matrix to AOM.txt in current folder
0 // Return to main menu

20 // Bond order density (BOD) and natural adaptive orbital (NAdO) analyses
1 // Use atomic overlap matrix (AOM) for the analysis
[Press ENTER button] // Load the AOM.txt in current folder
1,2 // Indices of the two atoms to be analyzed
Then NAdOs are generated and you can find below information
Generating natural adaptive orbitals (NAdOs)...
Eigenvalues of NAdOs: (sum=

0.99999

3.11681 )
0.05728

0.05728

0.00113

0.00113

The values are eigenvalues of the NAdO orbitals, the sum (3.11681) just corresponds to the DI
between the two atoms. At the same time, NAdOs.mwfn is generated in current folder, in which the
first 7 orbitals are the NAdO orbitals, their occupation numbers correspond to the NAdO
eigenvalues. All other orbitals in this file are identical to the virtual MOs in the N2.fch.
Next, we input y to let Multiwfn load the newly generated NAdOs.mwfn. From now on, electron
density function directly corresponds to the BOD function. Now we plot the BOD as color-filled
map. Input below commands
0 // Return to main menu
4 // Plot plane map
1 // Electron density (which corresponds to BOD in the present context)
1 // Color-filled map
[Press ENTER button] // Use recommended grid setting
0 // Set extension distance

3 // YZ plane
0 // Z=0
Now the BOD map pops up. After some adjustments on plotting settings, you can see below

It can be seen that the distribution of BOD is reasonable, its main body is distributed in the
bonding area, showing that the electrons in this region has major contribution to the DI value and
play crucial role in the covalent bond.

4.200.20.2 Study BOD and NAdO orbitals for C-C bonds in butadiene
In this section, we will study BOD and NAdO orbitals for two kinds of C-C bonds in 1,3butadiene, whose geometry is shown below. This time the analysis will be performed based on the
AOM generated by AIM partition (using fuzzy partition like the last example is also reasonable).

Boot up Multiwfn and input
examples\butadiene.fch // Generated at B3LYP/6-31G** level
17 // Basin analysis module
1 // Generate basins and locate attractors
1 // Use electron density to define basins (i.e. AIM basins)

That means the DI of the central C-C bond is 1.114. Then input y to load the newly generated
NAdOs.mwfn file. After that, we use main function 5 to calculate grid data of electron density, which
now corresponds to BOD, and then plot it as isosurface. The resulting map with isovalue of 0.05 is
shown below.

It is obvious that most electrons that have significant contribution to the C4-C6 bond are
concentrated around this bond, this is what we expected.
Next, enter main function 0 to visualize various NAdO orbitals. Note that if you select "Orbital

The first 15 orbitals are NAdOs, their "Occ" values correspond to NAdO eigenvalues, which
can be regarded as contribution of the NAdOs to DI. All orbitals with index larger than 15 are the
virtual MOs in the examples\butadiene.fch, they are not of our interest. From the above list, it can
be seen that only the first two NAdO orbitals have prominent contribution to DI, their isosurface
maps are shown below, the eigenvalues are also labelled.

1022

--- page break ---

4 Tutorials and Examples

It can be seen that the first NAdO, which looks like a  type of localized orbital (see example
in Section 4.19.1 for more information about this point), has key contribution (0.901) to the DI value
(1.114); this is fully understandable, since the major ingredient of the C4-C6 bond must be 
interaction. The second NAdO also has nonnegligible contribution (0.245). Since it shows typical 
orbital character, we can infer that weak  interaction exists in the C4-C6 bond.
Now we turn our attention to the boundary C-C bonds, namely C1-C4 (or C6-C8). Reboot
Multiwfn and input below commands (you can first manually backup the previous NAdOs.mwfn to
avoid overwriting)
examples\butadiene.fch
200 // Other functions (Part 2)
20 // Bond order density (BOD) and natural adaptive orbital (NAdO) analyses
1 // Use atomic overlap matrix (AOM) for the analysis
[Press ENTER button] // Load the AOM.txt in current folder
1,4 // Indices of the two carbons at the boundary of the system
y // Load the newly generated NAdOs.mwfn
After that, use main function 0 to visualize the only two orbitals having significant
contributions to DI, as shown below (isovalue=0.05)

The  type of NAdO orbital of C1-C4 has comparable eigenvalue to that of C4-C6, indicating
that both two kinds of C-C bonds has similar strength of  interaction. In contrast, the  type of
NAdO orbital of C1-C4 has much higher contribution to DI than that of C4-C6, well reflecting the
fact that the boundary C-C bonds have much stronger  interaction than the central one.
At the end of this section, I would like to emphasize a quite noteworthy point of the
BOD/NAdO method, namely you can directly specify the bond to be studied, as already fully
illustrated above. For example, for the dopamine shown below, if you want to study BOD or
corresponding NAdOs for a bond, e.g. C5-C7, you simply need to input 5,7 when Multiwfn asks

1023

--- page break ---

4 Tutorials and Examples
you to input atom indices, clearly this feature makes bonding analysis quite convenient! Below map
shows BOD=0.03 isosurface for C5-C7.

Also it is noteworthy that the BOD/NAdO analysis can also be performed to visualize DI
between two basins based on the BOM.txt exported by basin analysis module. For example, you can
use basin analysis module to generate electron localization function (ELF) basins and then export
basin overlap matrix (BOM) to BOM.txt by corresponding option. After that, in the BOD/NAdO
analysis function, select to load the BOM.txt, and then input index of two basins of interest, the
NAdOs for the two local regions will be generated. Via this manner, you can visually study e.g.
electron sharing between two lone pair regions or between a lone pair and a covalent bonding region.
Clearly, the BOD/NAdO analysis module is extremely flexible!

4.200.20.3 Study interaction between two fragments using BOD/NAdO
I also extended BOD and NAdO analyses to the scenario of interfragment interaction. To
illustrate how to realize this, in this section I take oxirane as example molecule, the oxygen atom
and the two carbon atoms will be respectively defined as the two fragments. In addition, in this
example I will illustrate evaluation of energies for NAdOs.

We generate file containing AOMs as previous examples. Boot up Multiwfn and input
examples\oxirane.fchk

[Press ENTER button] // Load AOM.txt in current folder

The loaded AOMs are used to construct FOMs of the two fragments, the eigenvalues of
generated NAdOs are

As can be seen, there are three NAdO orbitals having notable contributions to DI. In addition, as
shown in the prompt on screen, energies of NAdOs are evaluated in this case.
After inputting y to load the newly generated NAdOs.mwfn in current folder, you can visualize
their isosurfaces in main function 0, as shown below. The eigenvalues and energies are also labelled:

It is obvious that the above three NAdO orbitals nicely elucidated the orbital interaction
between the fragment O1 and the fragment C1-C2, and in the interacting region the same phase
overlap can be clearly observed. Among them, the first NAdO has the lowest energy, indicating that
it has the largest contribution to the interfragment binding. Please then plot BOD map in the plane
defined by C1, C2 and O3 via main function 4 to visualize distribution of the electrons directly
contributing to the interfragment interaction.
This is only a very simple example showing the usefulness of BOD/NAdO of revealing
interfragment interaction, evidently it can also be applied to much more complicated situations to
gain deeper insights, such as the interaction between the iron atom and the two cyclopentadienyl
rings in ferrocene, the interaction between encapsulated atom and cage in atomic cluster.
Finally, I also would like to mention that in the fuzzy atom space analysis module, you can use
option -1 to switch the space partition method to Hirshfeld-I before generating AOM file; in some
case, especially when metal is involved, the result may be notably better than using the default
partition.
