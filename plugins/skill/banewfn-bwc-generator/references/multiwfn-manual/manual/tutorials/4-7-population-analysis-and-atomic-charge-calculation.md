4.7 Population analysis and atomic charge calculation
4.7.0 Mulliken population analysis on triplet ethanol
In this section I will illustrate how to use Multiwfn to carry out Mulliken analysis, triplet
ethanol is taken as instance. It is worth to note that Mulliken analysis is incompatible with diffuse
functions, if diffuse functions are employed, the analysis result will be meaningless.
Boot up Multiwfn and input
examples\ethanol_triplet.fch // Calculated at UB3LYP/6-31G** level based on optimized

select "-1 Choose output destination for option 1" to change the output destination to a specified

From the output, first you can find population of each basis function:

Since present system is an open-shell system, not only the total population (i.e. alpha+beta), but also
alpha and beta populations are outputted individually. The spin populations, which equal to
difference between alpha and beta populations, are also printed. The output content is easy to
understand, for example, from the output we can see that there are nearly two electrons located on
the first S basis function of C1 atom, and one of PZ basis functions of O8 atom has large amount of
unpaired electrons (0.557).
Next, we can find population of each basis function shell of each atom:

As you can see, for example, the basis function shell 30, which corresponds to one of P shells of O8,
has unpaired electrons of 0.648 and total population of 2.777.

The output shows that d type of atomic orbitals only have marginal contribution to total population
(0.02847) and spin population (0.01326) of the whole system, since D type of basis functions only
behave as polarization functions for present system. In O8, most unpaired alpha electrons are located
on its p atomic orbitals, while slight unpaired beta electrons are distributed on its s atomic orbitals
(positive and negative value indicate that the unpaired electrons are alpha and beta, respectively).
Finally, we can find atomic populations and atomic charges:

Triplet system has two unpaired electrons, one can see that in the triplet ethanol, most unpaired
electrons (more than 1.5) are located on the hydroxyl group. It is well known that in ground state
ethanol, oxygen atom should have significant negative charge due to very large electronegativity of
oxygen. However, in present system, the oxygen even carries marginal positive charge. This
observation reflects the fact that electronic structure of different electronic states may differ from
each other remarkably.
Mulliken population analysis does not show population information of each atomic orbital,
however, if you first identify correspondence between basis functions and atomic orbitals (see
Section 4.7.6 for details), you can easily obtain population of each atomic orbital by simply
summing up population of corresponding basis functions.

There are several other options in the Mulliken analysis interface, they can help you to gain
deeper insight into electronic population, please play with them by consulting corresponding
explanation in Section 3.9.3.

4.7.1 Calculate Hirshfeld and CHELPG atomic charges as well as
fragment charge for chlorine trifluoride
Calculating Hirshfeld charges
I have introduced the theory of Hirshfeld population in Section 3.9.1, to calculate Hirshfeld
charges for ClF3, input below commands in Multiwfn
examples\ClF3.wfn
7 // Population analysis and atomic charges
1 // Hirshfeld population
Hirshfeld population analysis requires electron density of atoms in their free-states, you need
to choose a method to calculate atomic densities. Selecting 1 to use built-in atomic densities is very
convenient, see Appendix 3 for detail; alternatively, you can select 2 to evaluate atomic densities
based on atomic .wfn files, see Section 3.7.3 for detail. Here we choose option 1. Now you can see
below output, not only the atomic charges, but also the dipole moment evaluated based on the atomic
charges is printed.

0.309313 a.u.

From the result we find the charges of the three fluorine atoms are unequal, the equatorial one
(F3) is -0.075, while the axial ones (F2 and F4) possess more electrons, their charges are thus more
negative, that is -0.224.
As shown on the screen, the sum of all calculated charges is 0.00001373 rather than exactly
zero as we expected, this is due to unavoidable numerical error of space integration. Considering
this, Multiwfn also prints the result after normalization to eliminate the marginal numerical error:

When using the calculated atomic charges for your research and article, adapting the normalized
charges is recommended, because their sum is exactly identical to net charge of current system.
Finally Multiwfn asks you if exporting the result, if you select y, the element names, atom
coordinates and atomic charges will be outputted to a plain text file with .chg extension, see Section
2.6 of introduction of .chg format. You can use this file as Multiwfn input file and select

“Electrostatic potential from atomic charges” in main function 3, 4, 5 (or other functions) to study
the electrostatic potential derived from Hirshfeld charges.
Calculating CHELPG charges
Next, we calculate CHELPG charge. CHELPG charge has been introduced in Section 3.9.10.
First, select subfunction 12 in the population analysis module, you will see a new menu. In general,
you do not need to modify the default options, and you can directly select option 1 to start the
calculation. Since calculation of ESP is time-consuming, for large system you may need to wait for
a while. The result is 0.5772 for Cl, -0.2496 for axial F and -0.0779 for equatorial F. The conclusion
of CHELPG charge is the same as Hirshfeld charge, namely axial F are more negatively charged
than the equatorial one.
Quickly evaluating fragment charge
Fragment charge is defined as sum of charge of atoms constituting a fragment. You can
manually sum up atomic charges to derive fragment charge; however, for large systems this process
must be laborious. In Multiwfn it is possible to directly calculate charge for a fragment. For example,
here we calculate CHELPG charge for the fragment composed by the two axial F atoms. Boot up
Multiwfn and input
examples\ClF3.wfn
7 // Population analysis
-1 // Define fragment
2,4 // Index of the two axial F atoms
12 // CHELPG charge
1 // Start calculation
Since the fragment has been defined, Multiwfn not only prints atomic charges, but also prints
fragment charge at the end of all output:
Fragment charge:

-0.499331

4.7.2 Calculate and compare ADCH atomic charges with Hirshfeld
atomic charges for acetamide
The ADCH (atomic dipole moment corrected Hirshfeld population) charge proposed by me is
an improved version of Hirshfeld charge, it resolved many inherent drawbacks of Hirshfeld charge,
such as poor dipole moment reproducibility, see Section 3.9.9 for brief introduction and my paper
J. Theor. Comput. Chem., 11, 163 (2012) for discussion and comparison. I highly recommend using
ADCH charge to characterize charge distribution. The calculation process of ADCH charges is
exactly identical to the one described in last section, the only difference is that you should select
option 11 instead of option 1 in population analysis interface. For example, here we calculate ADCH
charges for CH3CONH2. Boot up Multiwfn and input
examples\CH3CONH2.fch
7 // Population analysis and atomic charges
11 // Calculate ADCH charges
1 // Use built-in atomic densities in free-state
Multiwfn will calculate Hirshfeld charges first, and then perform atomic dipole moment
correction for them to yield ADCH charges. The result is shown below

It is obvious that for all atoms, the magnitude of ADCH charges are evidently larger than
Hirshfeld charges, the former are in agreement with common chemical senses, while the latter turns
out to be too small.
A remarkable feature of ADCH charges is that the molecular dipole moment can be exactly
reproduced. The dipole moment derived from ADCH charges is 1.4368 a.u. (as shown above), which
is exactly identical to the actual dipole moment, namely the one derived based on present electron
density distribution. (The error 0.0001385 comes from trivial numerical aspects and is totally
negligible).
If you scroll up the command-line window, you will find the following information
Total dipole from atomic charges:

1.073849 a.u.

This is the dipole moment derived from Hirshfeld charges, which deviates to actual dipole moment
(1.4368 a.u.) apparently. In fact, for almost all small molecules, Hirshfeld charges always severely
underestimate molecular dipole moments.
Again, it is recommended to employ the atomic charges after normalization (namely the ones
printed under "Final atomic charges" label).

4.7.3 Calculate condensed Fukui function and condensed dual
descriptor
Theory
In Section 4.5.4, I have introduced how to calculate and visualize Fukui function and dual
descriptor. In this section, we will calculate "condensed" version of these two functions, so that the
discussion of the possibility that an atom could act as a reactive site can be upgraded to quantitative
level. Phenol will still be used as example case.
Before calculating phenol, we first derive the expression of condensed Fukui function and
condensed dual descriptor. In the condensed version, atomic population number is used to represent

537

the amount of electron density distribution around an atom. Recall the definition of Fukui function
f +:

f + (r ) =  N +1 (r ) −  N (r )
The definition of condensed Fukui function for an atom, say A, can be written as

f A+ = pNA +1 − pNA
where pA is the electron population number of atom A.
Since atomic charge is defined as q = Z − p , where Z is the charge of atomic nuclear, the
A

A

A

f + can be expressed as the difference of atomic charges in two states (note that the two Z terms are
cancelled)

f A+ = qNA − qNA +1
By analogous treatments, one can easily formulate other types of condensed Fukui function

Nucleophilic attack : f A+ = qNA − qNA +1
Electrophilic attack : f A− = qNA −1 − qNA
Radical attack : f A0 = ( qNA −1 − qNA +1 ) / 2
Similarly, condensed dual descriptor can be written as

f A = f A+ − f A− = ( qNA − qNA +1 ) − ( qNA −1 − qNA ) = 2qNA − qNA +1 − qNA −1
There are numerous ways to calculate atomic charges, although currently there is no consensus
on which method is the most ideal one to study condensed Fukui function and dual descriptor, but
at least Hirshfeld charge has proven to be a very suitable choice. For example, J. Phys. Chem. A,
106, 3885 (2002), J. Phys. Chem. A, 107, 10428 (2003) and my work J. Phys. Chem. A, 118, 3698
(2014) illustrated Hirshfeld charge can be successfully used to study reactive site in terms of
condensed Fukui function. Furthermore, a comprehensive comparison given in Theor. Chem. Acc.,
138, 124 (2019) demonstrated that Hirshfeld charge may be the best choice of evaluating condensed
Fukui function.
Practical example: Phenol
Here we calculate the condensed Fukui function and dual descriptor for phenol, we still use the
phenol.wfn, phenol_N+1.wfn and phenol_N-1.wfn in "examples" folder, which have already been
utilized in Section 4.5.4

According to the procedure introduced in Section 4.7.1, we calculate Hirshfeld charges for all
carbons in phenol in its N, N+1 and N-1 electrons states, respectively, they are collectively given in
the following table. Then, according to the formulae shown above, the condensed f −, f + and dual
descriptor can be readily calculated, as shown below.

Note: The Hirshfeld charges reported above were estimated based on build-in sphericalized atomic densities.

For f −, the smallest two values occur at C2 and C6, therefore meta atoms are unfavorable sites
for electrophilic attack.
For dual descriptor, the most positive values occur at C2 and C6, suggesting that they are the
most unfavorable sites for electrophilic attack. C1 has a large negative value and hence favored by
electrophilic reactant. Although the two ortho carbons (C3 and C5) have positive value, its
magnitude is not as large as meta carbons, so dual descriptor indicates that ortho carbons are more
possible than meta carbons to be reactive site for electrophilic attack. Our conclusion is completely
in line with that of Section 4.5.4, in which we obtained the conclusion by visual inspecting
isosurface of Fukui function and dual descriptor.
IMPORTANT NOTE: In daily research, I strongly suggest you directly using main function 22
to automatically calculate condensed Fukui function and dual descriptor, because the steps are
extremely simple and meantime other useful quantities in conceptual density functional theory can
be printed together, see Section 3.25 for introduction and 4.22.1 for example.

4.7.4 Illustration of computing Hirshfeld-I atomic charges
Hirshfeld-I (HI) is a more advanced technique to define atomic spaces than its predecessor
(Hirshfeld). Before following the example given below please briefly read Section 3.9.13 to gain
basic knowledge of HI method and its implementation in Multiwfn. It is very important to note that
in order to calculate HI charge, atomic radial densities files (.rad) of various elements in the current
system at different charged states must be available. Commonly, I suggest you directly use the builtin .rad files in Multiwfn, so that you do not need to generate them before HI calculation. See Section
3.9.13 for detail about this point.
Here we calculate HI charges for CH3COCl. For convenience, we will directly use built-in .rad
files in this example. To do so, we copy "atmrad" folder from "examples" directory to current
directory, then the .rad files in this folder will be employed by Multiwfn in the HI charge calculation.
Boot up Multiwfn and input
examples\CH3COCl.wfn // Generated at B3LYP/6-31G* level
7 // Population analysis and atomic charges
15 // Hirshfeld-I method

Then you will see iteration process

The "maximum change" denotes the maximum change of HI atomic charges, the iteration
continues until "maximum change" is lower than the threshold, which is 0.0002 by default. After
convergence, Multiwfn prints final HI atomic charges:

Then you can choose if outputting these charges to .chg file in current folder. I suggest you
compare above result with Hirshfeld charges, you will find the magnitude of HI charges is much
higher than Hirshfeld charges. This phenomenon is expected, because HI atomic spaces properly
contract or expand with respect to that of neutral state according to actual chemical environment,
hence the size difference of atomic space among various atoms is greatly increased.
Letting Multiwfn automatically invoke Gaussian to generate .rad files
In principle, it may be best to generate atomic .rad files at the same level as the current molecule,
since in this case the result has strongest physical meaning. You can directly let Multiwfn to invoke
Gaussian to prepare the .rad files.
Before calculation, you should properly set "gaupath" in settings.ini file to actual Gaussian
executable file. In addition, if "atmrad" folder has existed in current directory and it contains .rad
files of C, H, O, and Cl elements, you should delete them.
Boot up Multiwfn and input
examples\CH3COCl.wfn // Generated at B3LYP/6-31G* level
7 // Population analysis and atomic charges
15 // Hirshfeld-I method
1 // Start calculation with default settings
B3LYP/6-31G* // The keyword of Gaussian used to calculate atomic .wfn files
From the prompts shown on screen, you can find that Multiwfn invokes Gaussian to calculate
atomic .wfn files for all elements involved in the present molecule at various charged states. Then
Multiwfn converts atomic .wfn files to .rad files, which record spherically averaged atomic radial
densities. The automatically generated Gaussian input file (.gjf), the resulting Gaussian output file
(.out or .log) and the .rad files are all produced in "atmrad" folder of current folder, you can manually
examine them if you have interesting.
In the current case, the resulting charges are

suggest directly using built-in .rad files since the calculation is easier in this case and Gaussian is
not needed.
If you do not delete the "atmrad" folder or clean it up, then when you recalculate HI charges
for CH3COCl, or calculate a molecule only consisting of C, H, O and Cl elements or some of them,
Multiwfn will directly perform HI calculation based on the existing .rad files in the "atmrad" folder
rather than invoke Gaussian to recalculate them.
Finally, it is noteworthy that the support of Hirshfeld-I in Multiwfn is never limited to
population analysis, this partition method can also be used to calculate orbital composition (main
function 8), and be applied in fuzzy analysis module (main function 15).

4.7.5 Calculating EEM atomic charges for ethanol-water cluster
Please first read Section 3.9.15 to understand basic features of Electronegativity Equalization
Method (EEM) charges before following this example. Here we calculate EEM charges for ethanolwater cluster, which contains as many as 492 atoms:

Evidently, calculating atomic charges by quantum chemistry method for such a large system is
too expensive; however, as you will see, evaluation of EEM charges even for a system composed
by hundreds of atoms is rather easy.
Note that in order to calculate EEM charges in Multiwfn, currently you have to use MDL
molfile (.mol) or .mol2 as input file, because only this file provides atomic connectivity information,
which is needed in the calculation of EEM charges.

The default EEM parameters were fitted by some researchers for reproducing B3LYP/6-31G*
CHELPG charges, therefore, the above EEM charges should be close to CHELPG charges evaluated
at B3LYP/6-31G* level (In fact, for present system, even if calculation of CHELPG charges is
feasible, the result should be much worse than the EEM charges we just obtained. Because it is wellknown that the quality of electrostatic fitting charges is very low for the atoms far from van der
Waals surface, while in present system there are numerous heavily buried atoms).
Note that there are also many other built-in EEM parameters, you can choose them via option
1 before calculation.
Note on calculating EEM charge of the system containing  conjugation
It is worth to note if one or more atoms are in  conjugation region, the conjugation must be
represented as Lewis structure in the inputted .mol or .mol2 file, otherwise the calculation cannot
be conducted.
For example, we use GaussView to create an azobenzene molecule:

Save it as .mol file, then use Multiwfn to calculate EEM charge based on this file, you will find
below error:
Error: Multiplicity of atom

1 ( 4) exceeded upper limit ( 3)!

The present EEM parameters do not support such bonding status, or connectivity
in your input file is wrong

To understand the reason, open the .mol file by text editor, you can find below two lines

which indicates that the bond multiplicity of 1-2 and 1-6 is 4, clearly this is unreasonable, because
formal bond order between two carbons cannot be four! This issue comes from the fact that

GaussView always records a conjugated bond in .mol as a quadruple bond. To solve this problem,
the best way is installing OpenBabel (freely available at http://openbabel.org), then use this
command to convert the previous .mol file to a new .mol file: obabel old.mol -O new.mol. Then if
you use GaussView to open the new.mol, you will find the bonding has fully satisfied Lewis structure:

Now we use Multiwfn to calculate its EEM charges again, you will find below output, which
is quite reasonable:

4.7.6 Determining correspondence between basis functions and atomic
orbitals via population analysis
Determine correspondence between basis functions and atomic orbitals is important if one want
to plot PDOS of some atomic orbitals via main function 10, or to evaluate contribution to molecular
orbitals from specific atomic orbitals using main function 8. The correspondence is easy to be
identified if Pople basis set is used. For example, 6-31G* implies using one basis function with
contraction degree of 6 to represent each inner atomic orbital, while each valence atomic orbital is
represented by a basis function with contraction degree of 3 and an uncontracted basis function.
However, for most of other type of basis sets, the correspondence is often difficult to be determined.
Fortunately, as will be illustrated in this section, if one studies total and spin population of basis
function shells via Mulliken population analysis, the correspondence can be unambiguously
identified.
Two typical examples will be given below, more examples and discussions can be found from
my blog article “Determining correspondence between basis functions and atomic orbitals via
population analysis” (http://sobereva.com/418, in Chinese). In below text atomic orbitals will be
denoted as lower case (e.g. s, p, d...), while basis functions will be written as upper case (e.g. S, P,
D...).

We want to identify which S basis functions respectively correspond to 1s, 2s and 3s atomic
orbitals, and which P basis function shells respectively correspond to 2p and 3p atomic orbital shells.
All the two unpaired electrons of triplet sulfur atom are distributed on 3p shell, since the sum
of spin population of 7P, 8P and 9P is 1.10840+0.32918+0.53879=1.976, which is nearly equal to
two, we can say that these three P shells correspond to 3p shell. The remainder 6P shell clearly
corresponds to 2p shell, this can also be confirmed that its population number is 5.840, which is
close to expected occupation number of 2p shell (6.0).
Then we check the case of S shells. The sum of population number of 3S, 4S and 5S is
1.17225+0.25631+0.68189=2.110, which is close to actual occupation number of 3s atomic orbital
(2.0); considering that occupation number of both 1S and 2S are close to 2.0, it can be concluded
that 1S, 2S and (3S,4S,5S) mainly represent 1s, 2s and 3s atomic orbitals, respectively.
Example 2: def2-TZVP for Au
For Au atom, def2-TZVP is a pseudopotential basis set with Stuttgart small core
pseudopotential, 60 inner electrons are replaced with pseudopotential, therefore only the valence
electrons 5s25p65d106s1 are explicitly represented by the def2-TZVP basis set. The
examples\Au_def2-TZVP.fch is the .fch file calculated at B3LYP/def2-TZVP level by Gaussian16
for a single Au atom at its ground state (doublet state). Load this file into Multiwfn and carry out
population analysis as the last example, you will see

Undoubtedly, all P shells (7P, 8P, 9P, 10P) represent the only p shell (5p), while all D shells
(11D, 12D, 13D) represents the only d shell (5d). Since the sum of population number of 5S and 6S
(i.e. 0.61385+0.38581) is exactly equal to 1.0, and meantime the sum of spin population number of
5S and 6S is also equal to 1.0, it is clear that the 5S and 6S shells collectively represent the 6s atomic
orbital, which has a single unpaired electron. The total electrons in the other four S shells (1S, 2S,
3S, 4S) is almost exactly 2.0, evidently the doubly occupied 5s is mainly represented by them.

4.7.7 Illustration of deriving RESP charges and normal ESP fitting
charges with extra constraints
In this section I will take many examples to substantially illustrate the use of the extremely
powerful and flexible RESP module of Multiwfn, which can very conveniently calculate standard
RESP atomic charges and normal ESP fitting charges with/without charge and equivalence
constraints. Reading Section 3.9.16 is strongly recommended so that you have enough knowledge
about the RESP module as well as adequate understanding on the idea of ESP fitting method.
More detailed descriptions and discussions can be found from my blog article "Principle of
RESP charge and its calculation in Multiwfn" (in Chinese, http://sobereva.com/441).
For saving space, only the most important files involved in below examples are provided in
"examples\RESP" folder, while other files, including Gaussian output files and .fch files, can be
downloaded at http://sobereva.com/multiwfn/extrafiles/RESP.zip.
In this section, only example of deriving RESP charges for ground state is given. It is also easy to calculate
RESP charges for excited state. You can follow this example http://sobereva.com/wfnbbs/viewtopic.php?pid=747 if
you are a Gaussian user.
Hint: Speeding up ESP calculation by cubegen. Since calculation of ESP on fitting points is a computationally
demanding step, while calculation speed of ESP of internal code of Multiwfn is slower than the cubegen utility in
Gaussian package if number of your CPU cores is less than 10, therefore if Gaussian is available on your machine
and the input file is .fch/fchk, it is suggested to allow Multiwfn to invoke cubegen to evaluate ESP to reduce cost of
deriving ESP fitting charges. You simply need to set "cubegenpath" parameter in settings.ini to actual path of cubegen
executable file in your machine. See Section 5.7 for detail.

4.7.7.1 Example 1: Deriving RESP charges for dopamine in ethanol
environment
In this section I introduce the procedure of calculating standard RESP atomic charges for
dopamine. Ethanol solvent environment is assumed and it will be represented using IEFPCM
implicit solvation model. The structure of dopamine is shown as below.

Commonly, the geometry used for deriving RESP charges should be optimized at reasonable
level. Above geometry was optimized at B3LYP-D3(BJ)/6-311G** level with IEFPCM implicit
solvation model, and it was found to be the most stable geometry of present molecule.
Now, use Gaussian to run examples\RESP\dopamine-single\dopamine.gjf to generate
corresponding .fch file for this geometry. As can be seen in the .gjf file, the keywords are b3lyp/6311g(d,p) SCRF=solvent=ethanol, this combination is not expensive while the resulting
wavefunction is completely adequate to yield reliable RESP charges.
Boot up Multiwfn and input
dopmaine.fch // The .fch file just yielded
7 // Population analysis
18 // RESP module
1 // Calculate standard RESP charges using two-stage fitting procedure
During the calculation, Multiwfn first sets up atomic radii and determines position of fitting
points, and then calculates ESP values at the fitting points. After that, the first stage of standard
RESP calculation starts, the parameters and conditions employed in this stage can be found from
outputted information:
No charge constraint is imposed in this stage
No atom equivalence constraint is imposed in this fitting stage

As indicated in the output, in the second fitting stage, the two hydrogens at each of the two
−CH2− groups are required to be equivalent during the fitting. In addition, charges of only six atoms
are fitted in the stage 2, they are carbons and hydrogens in the two −CH2− groups, while charges of
other atoms keep unchanged at the values yielded in fitting stage 1.

If you examine the charges carefully, you will find all charges are chemically meaningful. The

equivalence constraints indeed work, the H12 and H13 share the same charge 0.0727, while both
H14 and H15 have charge of -0.064.
Directly loading fitting points and ESP values from Gaussian output file
As mentioned in Section 3.9.16.2, during calculation of ESP fitting charges in the RESP
module, it is possible to make Multiwfn directly load fitting points and ESP values from Gaussian
output file of pop=MK or pop=CHELPG task. As an illustration, the Gaussian input file of
dopamine for this purpose is provided as examples\RESP\dopamine-single\dopamine_pop_MK.gjf,
use Gaussian to run it, then boots up Multiwfn and input
dopmaine.fch // In present situation this file in fact is only used to provide geometry
information so that Multiwfn can determine atomic connectivity, therefore you can also use other
formats such as .xyz, .pdb and .wfn instead
7 // Population analysis

1 // Calculate standard RESP charges using two-stage procedure
dopamine_pop_MK.out // The Gaussian output file with IOp(6/33=2,6/42=6) pop=MK
keywords
Then the calculation of atomic charges will be completed very quickly, because calculation of
ESP values are avoided. Since the number and positions of fitting points generated by Multiwfn and
those generated by Gaussian pop=MK task are different, current result is slightly different to that
we obtained earlier.

4.7.7.2 Example 2: Taking multiple conformations into account during RESP
charge calculation of dopamine
In this example we still calculate standard RESP charges for dopamine, but multiple
conformations are explicitly considered in the ESP fitting procedure. It was found that there are four
dominating conformations of dopamine in gas phase, the corresponding Gaussian input files of
optimization task at B3LYP-D3(BJ)/6-311G** level have been provided in
examples\RESP\dopamine_4conf folder, run them by Gaussian and then convert the resulting .chk
files to .fch files.
My earlier Gibbs free energy calculations showed that at room temperature, according to
Boltzmann distribution, the population of the four conformers are 8.48%, 2.66%, 48.45% and
40.42%, respectively. Therefore we should write a plain text file named conf.txt (other filenames
are also acceptable) with below content, assuming that all the .fch files have been put into current
folders.
dopamine1.fch 0.0848
dopamine2.fch 0.0265
dopamine3.fch 0.4844
dopamine4.fch 0.4041

The first column is file path of each conformer, while the second column is corresponding weight.
Evidently, the sum of all weights must be exactly equal or approximately equal to unity.
Boot up Multiwfn and input
dopamine1.fch // In present case, the file loaded at this stage is only used to provide geometry
information that used to determine atomic connectivity, thus you can also use .fch of other
conformers, the result will not be affected

As can be seen, when considering multiple conformations, Multiwfn gives RMSE and RRMSE
for each conformer as well as weighted RMSE and RRMSE. The data shows that current atomic
charges have better ESP reproducibility for conformations 3 and 4 than conformations 1 and 2. The
reason is not difficult to interpret, because the weights of conformations 3 and 4 in conf.txt are
significantly higher than 1 and 2, therefore the fitted charges prone to faithfully represent charge
distribution of conformers 3 and 4.
It is worth to note that if you set weight of conformer 1 in the conf.txt to 1.0 while set that of
other ones to zero, then the outputted statistical error will be

It can be seen that the atomic charges obtained at this time represent ESP of conformer 1 very
well, because the RMSE and RRMSE are small, while ESP reproducibility of conformers 3 and 4,
which have highest probability of occurrence, is no longer quite good. Therefore, current RESP
charges is not ideal for molecular dynamics modeling of dopamine. This observation reflects the
importance of considering multiple conformations for flexible molecules. Indeed, explicit
consideration of multiple conformations in ESP fitting is somewhat troublesome and timeconsuming, if you decide to obtain ESP fitting charges only by single structure, you should at least
use the structure with the lowest free energy as much as possible.
Directly loading fitting points and ESP values from Gaussian output file of each
conformer
When considering multiple conformations, the coordinates of fitting points as well as ESP
values can also be directly loaded from Gaussian output files, here I present an example. For present
molecule, the Gaussian input files of pop=MK task corresponding to the four conformers have been
provided in "examples\RESP\dopamine_4conf\ESP" folder, run them by Gaussian to obtain .out
files, then write a plain text file named e.g. confESP.txt with below content, with assumption that
the four .out files have been placed to C:\ directory.
C:\dopamine1_ESP.out 0.0848
C:\dopamine2_ESP.out 0.0265
C:\dopamine3_ESP.out 0.4844
C:\dopamine4_ESP.out 0.4041

After that, load .fch (or other kinds of files) of any conformer into Multiwfn and enter interface
of RESP module, then select
-1 // Load conformation list file
confESP.txt // Input actual path of this file
8 // Make Multiwfn directly load fitting point information from Gaussian output file
1 // Calculate standard RESP charges using the two-stage procedure
Then standard RESP charges will be immediately shown.

4.7.7.3 Example 3: Imposing equivalence constraint in ESP fitting of
Dimethyl phosphate
Calculation of standard ESP charges has been illustrated in above two examples, next I
exemplify how to calculate normal ESP fitting (i.e. one-stage fitting) with equivalence constraint.
Dimethyl phosphate is taken as instance, its structure is shown below

The two methoxy groups of this system are chemically equivalent, and are easily rotated around
O-P bond during molecular dynamic simulation. Therefore, the charges of O5 and O6 should be the
same, the charges of C7 and C11 should be the same, and a total of six hydrogens on the two methyl
groups (H8, H9, H10, H12, H13, H14) should also be the same. However, when only one structure
is taken into account, it is clear that the such expectation in charge distribution cannot be achieved.
Present example uses this system to demonstrate how to calculate the ESP fitting charges that meet
the above equivalence requirements.
We first create a plain text file called e.g. eqvcons.txt, where each row contains indices of the
atoms whose charges will be constrained to be the same. Therefore, the file content corresponding
to current situation should be (in random order)
5,6
7,11
8-10,12-14

Run the Gaussian input file of optimization task at B3LYP-D3(BJ)/6-311G** level for present
molecule (examples\RESP\C2H7O4P\C2H7O4P.gjf), then convert the resulting .chk file to .fch.
Next, Boot up Multiwfn and input

in each CH2 and CH3 group are constrained to be equivalent)

RRMSE:

Obviously, the result fully satisfies the equivalence constraint we have made, and the atomic
charge values are also very reasonable and chemically significant. If we do not make the customized
constraint but employ the default equivalency setting, the RRMSE will be 0.113024. Although the
equivalence constraint we have made increases the RRMSE, indicating that the ESP reproducibility
is lowered, since the RRMSE does not increase too much, the constraint we currently employed is
within reasonable range.
Note that in the standard two-stage RESP charge calculation, customized charge constraint and equivalence
constraint can also be applied, however they only take effect for the first stage (by default no constraint is employed
in this stage). For the present molecule, if you load equivalence constraint from the above eqvcons.txt and then select
0 to perform two-stage RESP fitting, you will find the O5 and O6 share identical charge in the result, but charges of
C7 and C11 are different, and charges of hydrogens in different methyl groups are also different, this is because the
customized constraints do not take effect for the second stage (according to standard definition of two-stage RESP
fitting, the carbons and hydrogens in the two methyl groups are refitted at the second stage).

4.7.7.4 Example 4: Evaluation of atomic charges of aspartic acid residue
with equivalence and charge constraints
This example is more complicated than the previous three ones, because multiple
conformations, equivalence constraints and charge constraints are all involved. After carefully
reading this section, I believe you will deeply feel that the RESP module of Multiwfn is amazingly
flexible.
In this section we will calculate ESP fitting charges for aspartic acid (ASP) residue. The ASP
is one of the most important amino acids in proteins. In general, in order to make electronic structure
of a given residue in quantum chemistry calculation close to that in actual protein environment, the
nitrogen terminal of the residue should be capped by acetyl group (ACE) while carbon terminal
should be capped by N-methyl amide (NME). For present case, this treatment results in a model
system ACE-ASP-NME.
The two most typical secondary structures of proteins are alpha helix and beta-sheet. From the
point of view of the residues that make up them, the difference comes from the phi and psi dihedrals
of the residue backbone. It has been suggested that residue conformations corresponding to both the
secondary structures should be taken into account in the ESP fitting procedure. Also note that the
net charge of the residue segment in the ACE-ASP-NME system must be an integer. Assume that
the proton of the carboxyl group of the ASP side chain has dissociated, the net charge of the ASP

551

4 Tutorials and Examples
residue should be constrained to be -1.0. In addition, given that the two oxygens of the carboxylate
are chemically equivalent, it is preferable to apply an equivalence constraint to the two oxygens.
The two hydrogens in the CH2 group of the ASP side chain should also be constrained to be
equivalent.
The Gaussian input files of optimization task for the ACE-ASP-NME models corresponding
to alpha helix and beta-sheet have been provided as alpha.gjf and beta.gjf in "examples\RESP\ACEASP-NME" folder. As can be seen in the files, the keywords correspond to B3LYP-D3/6-311G**
level with IEFPCM solvation model to represent water environment. In the optimization, the phi
and psi dihedrals are fixed to their initial values (the dihedrals will vary remarkably during
optimization if they are not frozen). In alpha.gjf, the phi and psi are -90 and -60, respectively,
corresponding to typical case of alpha helix. While in beta.gjf, the two dihedrals are set to -100 and
130, reflecting typical situation of beta-sheet.
Run the two .gjf files by Gaussian, and convert resulting .chk files to .fch format. The two
optimized structures are shown below. The region surrounded by green dashed ellipse is the ASP
residue, the charges of these atoms are what we are interested in. The phi and psi dihedrals
mentioned above correspond to 6-3-1-13 and 1-3-6-19, respectively.

We create a plain text file named for example chgcons.txt, in this file each line defines a charge
constraint term. Since we require that the ASP residue has total charge of -1, we should write below
content in this file
1-12 -1

Note that in the RESP module, there is no upper limit on the number of charge constraint terms.
Also note that the indices of the atoms involved in charge constraint are not necessarily contiguous,
for example if you write 1,3-5,8,9-12 1.5, then sum of charges of atoms 1,3,4,5,8,9,10,11,12 will be
constraint to 1.5.
Then we create a plain text file named for example eqvcons.txt, in this file each line defines a
equivalence constraint term. As mentioned earlier, O11 and O12 should be equivalent, H7 and H8
should be equivalent, therefore for present case the content should be
11,12
7,8

Although the hydrogens in the methyl groups at the two ends of the model system are chemically

552

equivalent, since they are not of our interest, the equivalence constraint setting is ignored.
Next, we write a file named for example conflist.txt, which contains list of .fch files of all
conformers. In present circumstance we hope that the resulting atomic charges can equally well
represent the actual charge distribution of ASP residue in both alpha helix and beta-sheet secondary
structures, therefore weight of both the conformers should be 0.5. Assuming that .fch files have been
placed in D:\ folder, the file content should be
D:\alpha.fch 0.5
D:\beta.fch 0.5

Finally, boot up Multiwfn, load either alpha.fch or beta.fch, then enter RESP module and input
below commands
5 // Modify the equivalence constraint
1 // Load equivalence constraint setting from external plain text file
eqvcons.txt // The equivalence constraint file we created
6 // Set charge constraint
1 // Load charge constraint setting from external plain text file
chgcons.txt // The charge constraint file we created

have comparable magnitude. Given that the RRMSE is very small, the current fitted charges should

4.7.7.5 Example 5: Example of setting equivalence constraint according to
local or global point group symmetry

1: A small molecule
To obtain ESP fitting charge for below molecule, we should constrain the three fluorine atoms
to have the same charge because they are chemically equivalent. In addition, due to symmetry of
the local geometry of the benzene moiety, the atoms at its two sides should be equivalent, namely
we should constrain H5=H7, H10=H6, C2=C4, C3=C9.

Although you can manually create a file containing above equivalent constraints, it is more
convenient to make Multiwfn automatically create the file according to point group symmetry of
local regions of the CF3 group and benzene moiety, as shown below.
Boot up Multiwfn and input
CF3benCOCH3.fch
7 // Population analysis and atomic charge calculation
18 // RESP module
5 // Set equivalence constraint
11 // Generate a file containing equivalence constraints according to point group symmetry of
selected regions
Then we need to input atomic indices in each fragment that has local symmetry. In order to
make finding the indices convenient, I suggest using GaussView to open the above .fch file, then
select the fragment as yellow, then enter "Tools" - "Atom Selection" and copy the atomic indices
from the text box to Multiwfn window, as illustrated below

The region colored by yellow has point group of C2v, if we provide the corresponding indices
1-7,9-10 to Multiwfn, then Multiwfn will find symmetrically equivalent atoms and write to
eqvcons_PG.txt in current group (Notice that we should not select the whole benzene moiety,

554

--- page break ---

4 Tutorials and Examples
namely 1-7,9-11, because this fragment has point group of D2h, in this case Multiwfn will also regard
C1 and C11 as symmetrically equivalent atoms).
Now we input 1-7,9-10 in Multiwfn window, then you will see
Detected point group: C2v

Accept and append to eqvcons_PG.txt in current folder? (y/n)

Clearly, symmetrically equivalent atoms have been correctly identified, therefore we input y to write
the corresponding constraint setting to eqvcons_PG.txt in current folder.
Next, we use this feature to add the three fluorine atoms into the equivalence constraint file. In
the Multiwfn window we input atomic indices of the CF3 group, namely 13-16, then you will see
Detected point group: C3v
Number of symmetry-equivalence classes:

in the methyl group as equivalent atoms by this interface, however we do not do this because in this
example we will employ two-stage RESP fitting, at the second stage the equivalence constraint is
automatically applied to the three hydrogens.
Subsequently, in the Multiwfn window we input
1 // Load equivalence constraint from external file
eqvcons_PG.txt // The file just generated

2: Coronene
Let us see a molecule containing relatively large number of atoms and having high-order point
group, namely coronene, which has D6h point group.

Because the distribution of ESP fitting points does not satisfy point group symmetry, the
resulting charges thus do not fulfill D6h symmetry. For example, you will find C17 and C18 have
charge of -0.2243 and -0.2169, respectively, however their charges should be identical. Despite the
difference is negligible, it is best to eliminate it. The most ideal way to make the resulting charges
fully satisfy the point group is imposing equivalence constraint according to the symmetry, however
manually writing the constraint file is quite laborious for such a large system, therefore we again
use Multiwfn recognize point group and automatically generate the constraint file.
Boot up Multiwfn and input
coronene.fch

Then we input below commands
y // Write the four classes equivalent constraints to eqvcons_PG.txt in current folder
q // Exit
1 // Load equivalence constraint file
eqvcons_PG.txt
1 // Perform standard two-stage RESP fitting (note that the result is identical to one-stage
fitting, because no atoms will be refitted in the second stage for this molecule)
From the printed result, you can find the atoms in each of the four detected classes are indeed
equivalent. The value of aforementioned charges of C17 and C18 are -0.220866 currently, which is
quite reasonable.
By the way, via suboption 10 in option 5 you can export equivalence constraint of hydrogens
in all CH2 and CH3 to eqvcons_H.txt in current folder. If you combine this file and eqvcons_PG.txt
into a single file, then load it into Multiwfn and perform normal ESP fitting, the two kinds of
equivalence constraint will simultaneously take effect (however, the content of the two sets of
constraint should not be contradict to each other)
It is noteworthy that, sometimes after inputting atomic indices in the aforementioned subfunction 11 of option
5, Multiwfn does not print point group, that means the determination of point group is failed. However, this failure
does not necessary mean that the symmetrically equivalent atoms are not properly identified, therefore if the printed
atomic indices are reasonable, you can still input y to write the constraint to eqvcons_PG.txt. In contrast, if you find
the indices of the symmetrically equivalent atoms are not correctly identified, you should input n to cancel the
writting, and then modify the tolerance for determining point group (for example, inputting t 0.05 means changing
the tolerance to 0.05), after that you can input the atomic indices again and check if the equivalent classes have been
reasonably recognized. The default tolerance is 0.1, when you encounter problem, you can either try to increase it or
decrease it. Also note that the equivalent atoms are always correctly detected if the point group is correctly printed.

4.7.7.6 Example 6: RESP charge calculation with additional fitting centers
Multiwfn is able to calculate RESP charges for additional fitting centers, in other words, some
point charges to be fitted are not necessarily at nuclear positions. Such non-atomic point charge is
valuable in some cases, such as better reproducing ESP around lone pair and -hole regions, this
idea has already been employed in a few forcefields. In this example, I will illustrate how to fit

557

charge for non-atomic points by taking C18 system as example.
The C18 was very systematically and detailedly studied in my work Carbon, 165, 468 (2020),
Carbon, 165, 461 (2020) and http://sobereva.com/carbon_ring.html for more. The ESP colored vdW
surface map is shown below

The minimum structure of C18 has D9h point group, therefore, if we calculate RESP charges as
usual, all resulting atomic charges will be exactly zero. Clearly such atomic centered charges are
completely useless in reproducing ESP around vdW surface for this very special system. In order to
better represent its ESP, it is best to fit some point charges located at midpoint of each C-C bond.
The .fchk file of C18 system corresponding to B97XD/def2-TZVP wavefunction at minimum
point structure can be download here: http://sobereva.com/multiwfn/extrafiles/C18.zip. If you place
additional fitting centers at midpoint of each C-C bond, the situation will correspond to below map,
in which each purple sphere corresponds to an additional fitting center. The Gaussian .gjf file
corresponding to below map has been provided as examples\RESP\C18\C18.gjf.

In this instance, we will simultaneously fit atomic charges and the point charges at midpoint of
the C-C bonds.
Before starting RESP fitting calculation, we need to write a text file containing X, Y, Z
coordinate of all additional fitting centers, and the first line should be the total number of additional

558

4 Tutorials and Examples
fitting centers, see examples\RESP\C18\fitcen.txt.
In addition, we need to write an equivalence constraint file to ensure that the resulting point
charges in each set are exactly identical: (1) Atomic charges of all carbons (2) All points at midpoint
of short C-C bonds (3) All points at midpoint of long C-C bonds. The constraint file has been
provided as examples\RESP\C18\eqvcons.txt, whose content defined three batches of constraints:
1-18
19,21,23,25,27,29,31,33,35
20,22,24,26,28,30,32,34,36

Note that the index of additional fitting centers is after that of actual atoms, therefore the points
19~36 in the eqvcons.txt correspond to the 18 points defined in the fitcen.txt.
Also note that there is no reason to apply the penalty function defined in RESP method, which
hurts the reproducibility of ESP in the present case, therefore we will disable this treatment, which
is enabled by default.
Now we boot up Multiwfn and input below command
C18.fchk
7 // Atomic charge calculation and population analysis
18 // RESP
4 // Set hyperbolic penalty parameters
2 // Set restraint strength (a) for one-stage fitting
0 // Remove effect of penalty function

If we do not specify additional fitting centers in the RESP calculation, you will find the atomic
charges of all carbons are exactly zero, and the ESP reproduction error will be
RMSE:

0.001911

RRMSE:

1.000000

The error is nearly twice as larger as the case having additional fitting centers at midpoint of bonds,
indicating that employing point charges not located at the center of atoms is crucial in faithfully
representing ESP on molecular surface.
There are a few notes about additional fitting centers:
• Additional fitting centers have zero radii, namely they do not affect distribution and number
of fitting points.
• Penalty function in the RESP method also takes effect for additional fitting centers.
• When multiple conformers are taken into account in the fitting, additional fitting centers
should be defined for different conformers, the format of the file defining these points in this case
is described in "Option 9" in Section 3.9.16.2. The distribution of additional fitting centers can be
different for different conformers, but the number must be the same.
• Both equivalence constraint (as illustrated in the present example) and charge constraint work
normally for additional fitting centers.

4.7.7.7 Skill 1: Using two times of one-stage fitting to equivalently realize
standard RESP two-stage fitting
In example 1 of this Section, I have illustrated how to derive RESP charges using standard
RESP two-stage fitting procedure. Thanks to the flexibility of RESP module of Multiwfn, this
“composite procedure” can also be manually realized via two separated one-stage fittings, as
illustrated in this section. After reading this section, I believe you will better understand how to
customize the RESP calculation procedure. Below we will use a very simple molecule methanol as
example, whose .fch file can be found in http://sobereva.com/multiwfn/extrafiles/RESP.zip.
Boot up Multiwfn and input
methanol.fch

Then input below commands in Multiwfn interface

which are completely identical to the charges derived by standard two-stage RESP fitting.
Hint: When the molecule is large, manually editing the chgcons.txt is often troublesome. In
fact, you can create an empty file named chgcons_stage2.txt in current folder and carry out standard
two-stage RESP fitting, then before performing the second stage fitting, Multiwfn will automatically
export the indices and charges of the atoms whose charges will be kept fixed in the second stage to
this file, so that you will not need to manually write the chgcons.txt file.

4.7.7.8 Skill 2: Quickly obtaining RESP charges from molecular structure file
by only one command
Note 1: Chinese version of this section is my blog article “A super lazy script to calculate RESP atomic charges
(one line of command calculates the result)” (http://sobereva.com/476).
Note 2: examples\RESP\RESP_ORCA.sh script has identical use as the RESP.sh script described in this section,
but it invokes ORCA instead of Gaussian. Before using it, please modify content after “ORCA=”, “orca_2mkl=”
and “nprocs=” at beginning of the script properly.

In this section, I will show it is fully possible to use only one command to generate RESP
charges directly from molecular structure file using Linux shell script, the user does not need any

Assume that both Gaussian and Multiwfn have been properly installed on your machine, and
you want to calculate RESP charges for H2O.xyz in ethanol environment, what you need to do is
simply:
• Copy RESP.sh from “examples\RESP” folder to current folder.

4 Tutorials and Examples
• Run chmod +x ./RESP.sh to add executable permission to the script
• Move the H2O.xyz to current folder
• Run ./RESP.sh H2O.xyz 0 1 ethanol, where 0 and 1 correspond to net charge and spin
multiplicity, respectively; ethanol is solvent name.
This script first automatically invokes Gaussian to optimize the geometry at B3LYPD3(BJ)/def2-SVP level, then performs single point task at B3LYP-D3(BJ)/def2-TZVP level and
meantime produce ESP data on vdW surface. Implicit solvation model is used for representing
ethanol environment. Then this script converts .chk file to .fchk file via formchk, and finally, invokes
Multiwfn to yield RESP charges in standard manner. After all steps have been successfully
completed, you will find H2O.chg in current folder, whose final column is RESP charges.
Any input file supported by Multiwfn containing molecular geometry information can be used
as input file for this script, such as .xyz, .mol, .mol2, .pdb, .gjf, .fch and so on.
If you do not explicitly specify net charge and spin multiplicity when booting up the script, the
system will default to singlet neutral system. If solvent name is not specified, it will default to water;
if you set gas as solvent name, the calculation will be conducted under vacuum. The supported
solvent names can be found at end of this page: http://sobereva.com/g09/k_scrf.htm.
Note that you sometimes need to properly modify the RESP.sh before running it. This script by
default invokes Gaussian 09, therefore if you are using other version, you need to replace the "g09"
in this script with "g16". In addition, if you find the def2-TZVP is too expensive or geometry
optimization was found to be difficult to converge in rare cases, you need to manually change the
keywords in this script.

4.7.7.9: Special topic: Calculation of RESP2 charges
Note: Much more in-depth discussions about RESP2 charge can be found in my blog article
"Idea of RESP2 atomic charge and its calculation in Multiwfn" (in Chinese,
http://sobereva.com/531).
Definition of RESP2 charge
In solvent environment, charge distribution of solute is evidently polarized by surrounding
solvents. Therefore, if atomic charges of a molecule are used in molecular dynamics (MD)
simulation with fixed charge forcefield (i.e. non-polarizable forcefield), the polarization effect must
be effectively taken into account into the atomic charges.
In Commun. Chem., 3, 44 (2020), the authors defined RESP2 charge as
RESP
RESP
q RESP 2 = (1 −  )qgas
+  qwater

RESP
RESP
where  is adjustable parameter, 𝑞gas
and 𝑞water
are RESP charges calculated in gas phase and in

water environment (represented by PCM implicit solvation model), respectively. The authors
employed PW6B95 exchange-correlation functional in combination with aug-cc-pVDZ basis set in
the process of quantum chemistry calculations. It is found that =0.6 leads to lowest overall error in
simulation of various condensed phase properties (=0.5 works equally well). Note that RESP2 with
=0.5, namely RESP20.5, is equivalent to the IPolQ-mod atomic charge defined in J. Comput. Aided
Mol. Des., 28, 277 (2014). These studies showed that =0.5 should be a relatively general and ideal
RESP
choice for evaluating RESP2 charge. Note that directly using 𝑞water
for the MD simulation in
aqueous environment leads to worse result for many properties compared to RESP20.6, this is mainly

RESP
because the 𝑞water
exaggerates the extent of polarization or does not properly account for cost of
electronic polarization.
In my opinion, the best way of calculating atomic charges used for condensed phase MD
simulation should be the RESP20.5 defined as follows
RESP
RESP
q RESP 2 = 0.5  qgas
+ 0.5  qsolv

RESP
where 𝑞solv
is RESP charge calculated under actual solvent environment represented by PCM (or
IEFPCM, CPCM, SMD) model. I suggest using B3LYP-D3(BJ) with def2-SVP (or the better one
def-TZVP) for geometry optimization and B3LYP-D3(BJ)/def2-TZVP for the subsequent single
point task calculations in both gas and solvent phases. In principle it is best to perform optimization
under actual solvent environment, however solvent effect on geometry can be safely ignored if the
system is neutral and there is no highly ionic local region.

Example of calculating RESP2 charges
As an example, we calculate RESP20.5 charge via the above recommended way for H2CO in
ethanol environment.
Copy below content into a Gaussian input file and then run it by Gaussian. This task consists
of three steps, namely geometry optimization, single point calculation in gas phase and then in
ethanol phase.

Using shell script to conveniently calculate RESP20.5 charges
In order to make calculation of RESP2 charge even easier, a Linux script named calcRESP2.sh
is provided in "examples\RESP" folder, it can calculate both RESP and RESP2 charges. Examples
of usage:
• Calculation of RESP charges: ./calcRESP.sh gas.fchk
• Calculation of RESP20.5 charges: ./calcRESP.sh gas.fchk solv.fchk
• Calculation of RESP20.7 charges: ./calcRESP.sh gas.fchk solv.fchk 0.7
Since the script invokes Multiwfn, before running it you should make sure that Multiwfn has
been properly installed in your Linux system, see Section 2.1.2 on how to install.
Once running of the script has successfully finished, you will find RESP2.chg in current folder,
the last column corresponds to the resulting RESP2 charges.
Quickly obtaining RESP2 charges from molecular structure file by only one command
In order to make RESP2 charge calculation as easy as possible, I also provide a script named
RESP2.sh in "examples\RESP" folder. Only a file containing (non-optimized) geometry is needed
as input file. This script is very similar to the RESP.sh introduced in Section 4.7.7.8.
Examples of usage:
• Calculating RESP20.5 charges for a singlet neutral molecule for MD simulation in water phase:
./RESP2.sh H2O.pdb
• Calculating RESP20.5 charges for a triplet neutral molecule for MD simulation in water phase:
./RESP2.sh yoshiko.xyz 0 3
• Calculating RESP20.5 charges for a singlet anion for MD simulation in ethanol phase:
./RESP2.sh yohane.mol -1 1 ethanol
As you can find from the examples, the charge and spin multiplicity are default to 0 and 1,
respectively, while the solvent is default to water.
If running the script has successfully finished, you will find a .chg file with identical name as
input file in current folder, the final column corresponds to RESP20.5 charges. In current folder you
can also find gas.chg and solv.chg, they correspond to the RESP charges in gas phase and in solvent

Specifically, this script do following things in turn, both Gaussian and Multiwfn are invoked in these processes:
(1) Geometry optimization at B3LYP-D3(BJ)/def2-SVP level in solvent environment
(2) Single point task at B3LYP-D3(BJ)/def2-TZVP level in gas phase
(3) Calculating RESP charge corresponding to gas phase

(5) Calculating RESP charge corresponding to solvent phase
(6) Generating RESP20.5 charge by averaging the result produced by (3) and (5)

this section, but it invokes ORCA instead of Gaussian. Before using it, please modify content after

4.7.8 Examine electrostatic potential reproducibility of atomic charges
Electrostatic potential (ESP) reproducibility is a crucial property of atomic charges, only
atomic charges having good ESP reproducibility could be employed to reveal intramolecular and
intermolecular electrostatic interactions. It is possible to examine ESP reproducibility of given
atomic charges using the MK and CHELPG charge calculation modules, which have been
introduced in Sections 3.9.10 and 3.9.11, respectively. Here we compare the ability of Hirshfeld and
ADCH charges for reproducing ESP values at Merz-Kollmann ESP fitting points (which are
distributed around molecular van der Waals surface) for CH3CONH2. We first calculate Hirshfeld
charges as usual using examples\CH3CONH2.fch (see Section 4.7.1), then select "y" to export the
atomic charges to CH3CONH2.chg. Then we enter the MK charge calculation module (subfunction
13 of main function 7) and input
-3 // Using atomic charges from a .chg file instead of fitting new charges
CH3CONH2.chg // Atomic charges (i.e. Hirshfeld charges) will be directly loaded from this
file
1 // Start calculation. In current case MK charges will not be yielded

These charges are just the Hirshfeld charges loaded from CH3CONH2.chg, the RMSE and RRMSE
measure the ESP reproducibility of the Hirshfeld charges. If you compute MK charges as usual, you
will find the RRMSE will be about 0.05, since as shown above the RRMSE of Hirshfeld charges is
as high as 0.31, it is evident that the ESP reproducibility of Hirshfeld charges is much worse than

565

4 Tutorials and Examples
MK charges. If you redo the analysis based on the .chg file containing ADCH charges, you will find
the RRMSE is 0.21. Clearly, ADCH charges have evidently lower error in reproducing ESP
compared to Hirshfeld charges.
Studying ESP reproducibility around different atoms or fragment
It is also possible to measure ESP reproducibility on the fitting points corresponding to specific
atom or fragment. By default, the MK points are generated around all atoms in turn and then the
points lying inside the innermost layer are pruned. If only specific atoms are taken into account, the
constructed MK fitting points will only correspond to those atoms. Let us compare ESP
reproducibility of Hirshfeld and ADCH charges around the amino group, only two MK layers with
scale factor of 1.4 and 1.6 will be considered (no special reason, just give an example). Enter the
MK module and input
-3 // Using atomic charges from a .chg file
CH3CONH2.chg // Assume that this file contains Hirshfeld charges
3 // Set number and scale factors of layers of MK fitting points
1.4 // Set scale factor of layer 1
1.6 // Set scale factor of layer 2
q // Setting has finished, now quit
4 // Choose the atoms considered in the construction of fitting points
7-9 // Atomic indices of amino group
1 // Start calculation
You will find below information from the output
RMSE:

0.008745

RRMSE:

0.374584

If we repeat the calculation based on .chg file containing ADCH charge, the output will be
RMSE:

0.003817

RRMSE:

0.163478

Since the RRMSE of ADCH charge (0.163) is by far less than that of Hirshfeld charge (0.374),
the ADCH charges have much better ESP reproducibility around the amino group.
Note: The CHELPG module also supports employing fitting points only for specific fragment.

Visualize fitting points and ESP values
If you want to visualize the fitting points corresponding to the amino group, you can select "6
Toggle if exporting fitting points with ESP after the task" once to change the status to "Yes" and
then use option 1 to start calculation. Once calculation is finished, choose 2 to export the fitting
points to ESPfitpt.pqr in current folder. This file can be directly loaded into the famous visualization
tool VMD. If you set the drawing method to "VDW" and change the "Sphere Scale" to 0.8, set
"Coloring Method" to "Charge", then set the color transition mode to "BWR" (Graphics - "Colors"
- "Color Scale"), you will see below graph (molecular structure file is also loaded).

Clearly, the fitting points well correspond to the amino group. The redder (bluer), the more
positive (negative) the ESP on the points.
Visualizing reproducibility error of ESP at fitting points
Finally, I would like to mention that the reproduction error of ESP can also be visualized by
using Multiwfn and VMD in combination. Here we check this for MK charges. Load the
examples\CH3CONH2.fch into Multiwfn, enter MK module, choose option 6 once, and then choose
option 1 to start calculation. Once calculation is completed, choose 3 to export ESP fitting points
with ESP reproduction error to ESPerr.pqr in current folder. In this file, the "Charge" column
corresponds to absolute value of difference (in kcal/mol) between the exact ESP and the ESP
evaluated based on current atomic charges (namely MK charges). If you render this file by VMD,
you will see below graph. The color scale has been set to -1.5 to 1.5 (can be set in "Graphics" "Representation" - "Trajectory" page), the default color transition "Red-White-Blue" is used,
perspective has been set to orthographic ("Display" - "Orthographic").

In this graph, more blue region corresponds to higher ESP reproduction error, while ESP at
white points can be well reproduced by the MK charges (i.e. the absolute error is close to zero). You
can also use this method to visualize ESP reproducibility of other atomic charges (need to use .chg

4.7.9 Calculate PEOE (Gasteiger) charge
In this example we calculate PEOE charge (also known as Gasteiger charge) for a typical
organic system, dopamine. Reading Section 3.9.17 is recommended to gain basic knowledge about
the principle, details and implementation of the PEOE method in Multiwfn.
Since calculation of PEOE charge only requires geometry information, we can use such
as .xyz, .pdb, .mol as input file. Boot up Multiwfn and input
examples\dopamine.xyz

Note that according to original paper of CM5 charge, the dipole moment calculated by CM5
charges can well reproduce experimental dipole moment in gas phase, therefore the dipole moment
shown above should be a reasonable estimation of actual gas phase dipole moment of the oxirane.
Calculation of 1.2*CM5 atomic charges
As demonstrated in J. Phys. Chem. B, 121, 3864 (2017), 1.2*CM5 charge is very suitable to
be adopted in molecular dynamics simulation with OPLS-AA forcefield for neutral species, namely
it can be regarded as a general way of deriving atomic charges when OPLS-AA is to be employed.
You can manually multiply the above printed CM5 charges by the factor of 1.2 to obtain the
1.2*CM5 charges, or more conveniently, directly select option -16 in main function 7. Note that in
this case, the CM5 charges should be calculated based on the wavefunction produced in vacuum
calculation, the enhancement factor of 1.2 is used to account for effective polarization of solute by
solvent environment. Since CM5 is not sensitive to calculation level, common DFT functional in
combination with 2-zeta basis set is adequate, such as B3LYP/def2-SVP.
In order to maximally simplify the procedure of evaluating 1.2*CM5 charges for people who
do not have any knowledge of quantum chemistry calculation, a Linux shell script is provided for
fully automatically evaluating 1.2*CM5 charges by invoking Gaussian and Multiwfn, see
examples\scripts\1.2CM5.sh. Using this script is extremely simple. For example, assume that this
script and a manually built molecular structure file phenol.xyz has been presented in the current
folder, you just need to run ./1.2CM5.sh phenol.xyz, then this script will first invoke Gaussian to
optimize the phenol at B3LYP-D3(BJ)/def2-SVP level and yield wavefunction at corresponding
level, then Multiwfn will be invoked to calculate CM5 charges, and finally a file named phenol.chg
will be automatically yielded in current folder, its last column is just 1.2*CM5 charges. You can
also specify net charge and spin multiplicity when running this script. Do not forget to open
1.2CM5.sh to check more information at the beginning of it.
examples\scripts\1.2CM5_ORCA.sh script has identical use as the 1.2CM5.sh script described
above, but it invokes ORCA instead of Gaussian. Before using it, please modify content after
“ORCA=”, “orca_2mkl=” and “nprocs=” at beginning of the script properly.
