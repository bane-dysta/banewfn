4.8 Molecular orbital composition analysis
In this section, I will show how to use various methods to analyze molecular orbital
compositions. The illustrated methods are also applicable to any other type of orbitals, e.g. natural
orbitals, natural transition orbitals (NTOs) and localized MOs (LMOs). Details about orbital
composition analysis can be found in Section 3.10. The pros and cons of different methods are very
detailedly discussed in my paper Acta Chim. Sinica, 69, 2393 (2011, http://siocjournal.cn/Jwk_hxxb/CN/abstract/abstract340458.shtml), citation is welcomed. If you can read
Chinese, also you can consult my blog article "On the calculation methods of orbital composition"
(http://sobereva.com/131).
Simply speaking, if your aim is merely obtaining atom compositions in orbitals,
Hirshfeld/Becke method may be the most robust and convenient way, see Section 4.8.3; if you also
would like to obtain atomic orbital composition, then the NAO method exemplified in Section 4.8.2
may be the best choice. The Mulliken method illustrated in Section 4.8.1 also generally works well
but diffuse functions should not be used.

4.8.1 Analyze acetamide by Mulliken method
In this example we employ Mulliken method to first analyze the composition of the 6th
molecular orbital of acetamide, and then analyze which orbitals have main contribution to the
bonding between formamide part and methyl group. Beware that Mulliken method is incompatible
with diffuse functions, if they are involved, you should either choose other orbital composition
methods (e.g. NAO, Hirshfeld...) or remove them from your basis set.
Boot up Multiwfn and input following commands
examples\CH3CONH2.fch // You have to use .mwfn/.fch/.molden/.gms file as input for this
type of analysis
8 // Orbital composition analysis
1 // Use Mulliken partition
6 // The orbital index is 6 (Note that as shown in the prompt on the screen, you can also input
orbital label here, for example h-3 corresponds to HOMO-3, l+1 corresponds to LUMO+1, etc.)
The composition of basis functions, shells and atoms are printed immediately, see below.

Orbital delocalization index:

The result indicates that nitrogen has primary contribution (65.5%) to orbital 6, and the
contribution consists of two S-shells (30.5% and 34.3%). P-shells of neighbouring carbon and Sshells of oxygen have slight contribution too (both are about 12%). We can check if the result is
reasonable by viewing isosurface (isovalue is set to 0.1 here):

From the graph, the region where the value of orbital wavefunction is large is mainly localized
around nitrogen, and there is no nodal plane, so the orbital wavefunction in this region should be
constructed from s-type orbitals. The isosurface also somewhat intrudes into the region of atom C5
and O6, so they should have small contribution to MO 6, moreover, because there is a nodal plane
in C5, the atomic orbitals of C5 used to form MO 6 should be p-type. Obviously, these conclusions
are in fairly agreement with composition analysis. The advantage of composition analysis is that the
result can be quantified, while by visual study we can only draw qualitative conclusion, for some
complex system we cannot draw even qualitative conclusion.
The " Orbital delocalization index" printed at the end of the output has close relationship with
extent of spatial delocalization of the orbital, this point will be described in Section 4.8.5 in detail.
Now let us find which molecular orbitals have main contribution to the bonding between
formamide part and methyl group. Boot up Multiwfn and input
examples\CH3CONH2.fch
8 // Orbital composition analysis
-1 // Define fragment 1
a 1-4 // Add all basis functions in atom 1, 2, 3, 4 (methyl group) into fragment1
q // Save fragment and return to upper menu
-2 // Define fragment 2
a 5-9 // Add all basis functions in atom 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 (formamide moiety) into fragment 2
q
4 // Print composition of fragment 1 and the cross term between fragment 1 and 2 in all orbitals
by Mulliken analysis. If you only defined fragment 1, then only composition of fragment 1 will be
printed
Since amount of the printed information is huge, I only extract cross term composition in all
occupied orbitals:

The product of the cross term composition between fragments 1 and 2 in orbital i and
corresponding orbital occupation number is the Mulliken bond order between them contributed by
orbital i. From above information we can see MO 7 and 11 are beneficial to bonding, because the
compositions are relative large, while MO 14 and 16 are not conducive for bonding. The isosurfaces
of MO 11 (left side) and 14 (right side) are shown below, it is clear that the result of composition
analysis is reasonable.

As you have seen, using Mulliken method to analyze orbital composition is very convenient.
However, the result of Mulliken method is sensitive to basis set, and is not as robust as NAO method
and Hirshfeld method illustrated below. Especially, do not use Mulliken method when diffuse
functions are involved in your calculation, otherwise the result will be meaningless!

4.8.2 Analyze water by natural atomic orbital method
In this example we analyze molecular orbital composition of water by the natural atomic orbital
(NAO) method discussed in Section 3.10.4. NAO method has much better basis set stability (i.e.
insensitive to the choice of basis set) and stronger theoretical basis than Mulliken or Mulliken-like
methods (such as SCPA and Stout-Politzer).
Note: NAO is never the only way of obtaining composition of atomic orbitals in MOs, you can also use Mulliken
or similar methods (e.g. SCPA) to do that. The correspondence between basis function and atomic orbital can be
identified according to basis set definition or by mean of population analysis, see Section 4.7.6.

Performing NAO method requires MO coefficient matrix in NAO basis, this matrix cannot be
generated by Multiwfn itself, but Multiwfn can utilize the output information containg this matrix
by stand-alone NBO program or NBO module embedded in quantum chemistry softwares. The
NBO 3.1 module embedded in Gaussian program is L607. Below is a Gaussian input file for water,
which will output the matrix we needed. Notice that the Gaussian task should be single point task,

8 // Enter orbital composition analysis module
7 // Enter NAO analysis function
You will find the default output mode is "Only show core and valence NAOs". Core and
valence NAOs have one-to-one correspondence with actual atomic orbitals, if the MO to be
analyzed is occupied, in general we only need to concern these NAOs, while Rydberg NAOs can be
ignored. Assume that we want to analyze MO 4, we input

According to the result, we can say for example, 2pz atomic orbital of oxygen has 84.09%
contribution to MO 4. The contributions from the NAOs listed above (Rydberg composition is not
included in the present example) are also summed up to atom contributions according to which
center they belong to.
Note that the sum of non-Rydberg compositions (i.e. Core + Valence), as shown above, is not
100 % rather than 99.777 %. To make the physical meaning more clear, I personally recommend to
manually perform renormalization for the result. For example, the composition of 2pz should be
84.089 % / 0.99777=84.277 %. Since before and after the renormalization the difference is only
0.188 %, the renormalization is not necessary for current case. Only when the non-Rydberg
composition is nonnegligible (e.g. larger than 2 %), the renormalization is indispensable.

Since none of the four NAOs in the fragment is core-type, the Core term is 0 % in the MOs.
Valence and Rydberg terms correspond to the contribution from NAOs 16, 18 and NAOs 17, 19
respectively. NAOs 16 and 18 directly correspond to 1s atomic orbital of H2 and H3, so we can say
that the two hydrogens collectively contribute 26.56 % to MO 3.
The first five MOs are doubly occupied in present system. It is clear that Rydberg NAOs have
very low contribution to the occupied MOs, while their contributions to virtual MOs are significant
and can no longer be ignored. The physical meaning of Rydberg NAOs is difficult to be interpreted,
and these NAOs do not directly reflect atomic orbital characteristics. It is questionable to say that
the two hydrogens contribute either 32.43 % or 62.00 % to MO 8. Although seemingly one can
employ renormalization process to "annihilate" the Rydberg composition, however when Rydberg
composition is too large, e.g. larger than 10 %, this treatment will break meaning of the result. So it
is not generally recommended to use NAO method to analyze atomic contributions to virtual MOs;
for this case, the Hirshfeld and Becke method introduced in Section 3.10.5 and exemplified in the
next section are the best choice.

4.8.3 Analyze acetamide by Hirshfeld and Becke method
In this section, we will first use Hirshfeld method and then Becke method to analyze the MO
composition of acetamide and compare the result with the one obtained by Mulliken method in
Section 4.8.1. Note that Hirshfeld and Becke methods are only capable of analyzing composition of
atom or fragment in orbitals, while the composition of atomic orbitals are impossible to be obtained
by these approaches.
Boot up Multiwfn and input
examples\CH3CONH2.fch // You can also use such as .wfn and .wfx file as input. But .wfn
and .wfx files do not contain virtual orbital information!
8 // Orbital composition analysis
8 // Use Hirshfeld partition
Hirshfeld analysis requires electron density of atoms in their free-states, you need to choose a
method to calculate atomic densities. Selecting 1 to use built-in atomic densities is very convenient,
see Appendix 3 for detail; alternatively, you can select 2 to evaluate atomic densities based on
atomic .wfn files, see Section 3.7.3 for detail. Here we choose option 1.
Then Multiwfn initializes the data, for large system you may need to wait for a while. Assume
that you want to analyze MO 6, then simply input 6, the result will be printed on screen, as shown
below. (Because the integrals are evaluated numerically, the sum of all terms will be slightly
deviated to 100%, so Multiwfn automatically normalizes the result.)

The composition of C5, O6 and N7 are 14.92%, 12.11% and 56.34%, respectively. This result
is close to the one obtained by Mulliken method (Section 4.8.1), namely 11.81%, 11.63% and
65.50%, respectively. In fact, for occupied MOs, if diffuse basis functions are not employed, in
general Mulliken, NAO and Hirshfeld methods give similar results.
Now let us check the composition of 7N in MO from 14 to 19. We input

the atomic population number of N7, and its Hirshfeld atomic charge is therefore 7.0-7.1589 = -0.1589.

Next, we examine contribution of the amino group to a specific orbital, HOMO. Input below
commands:
-9 // Define fragment
7-9 // The atoms in the amino group
h // This stands for HOMO. You can also directly input its index (16)
As shown below, you can not only see contribution from all atoms to the orbital, but you can
also find the fragment contribution to the orbital, the 8.703% is simply 6.791%+0.974%+0.938%.

As you can see, the result is highly close to that produced by Hirshfeld method.
In Multiwfn it is also possible to use Hirshfeld-I partition to calculate orbital composition,
however this is not commonly employed, because generating Hirshfeld-I atomic space requires
additional computational cost, while the result is not greatly improved (the orbital composition
computed by Hirshfeld method is already reliable and meaningful enough).

4.8.4 Calculate oxidation state by LOBA/mLOBA method
Note: Chinese version of this section is my blog article “Calculating oxidation state using LOBA method in
Multiwfn” (http://sobereva.com/362), which contains more discussions.

Please read Section 3.10.100 first to understand basic idea of the LOBA and mLOBA method.
This is a simple and useful method to evaluate oxidation state (OS). In this section I will use two
examples to illustrate the LOBA/mLOBA module in Multiwfn. The used .fch files can be directly
loaded at http://sobereva.com/multiwfn/extrafiles/LOBA.rar.
(1) Fe(CN)63First, we use Gaussian to perform regular calculation of this system, the input file is
examples\Fe(CN)6_3-.gjf, please run it yourself to get Fe(CN)6_3-.fch file. LOBA or mLOBA
analysis needs localized molecular orbitals (LMOs), thus we use Multiwfn to carry out orbital
localization. Boot up Multiwfn and input following commands:
Fe(CN)6_3-.fch
19 // Orbital localization
1 // Only localize occupied orbitals, this is enough for LOBA/mLOBA analysis
Now the molecular orbitals in memory have been replaced with LMOs. Then input
8 // Orbital composition analysis
100 // LOBA/mLOBA analysis
50 // Percentage threshold for performing LOBA

The sum of oxidation states:

-3

The result looks reasonable and in good agreement with chemical intuition. The sum of all
oxidation states just corresponds to the total net charge of -3. However, the LOBA is not free of
ambiguity, the choice of the threshold is highly arbitrary. If we input 60 instead of 50, we will see
oxidation states of carbon and oxygen become 4 and -1, respectively, and the sum of oxidation states
become 21. Fortunately, the OS of transition metal is not so sensitive to the choice of threshold, the
iron always keeps +3 oxidation state in present case as long as the threshold is not set to very small
or very large. Usually, the most appropriate threshold for evaluating OS of transition metal is
50~60%).
I strongly suggest using mLOBA instead of LOBA. If you input m here, you will obtain OS
values of mLOBA method, in this example the results of mLOBA and LOBA are exactly the same.
mLOBA fully gets rid of the arbitrariness of choice of the threshold.
(2) Ferrocene
For this system, we will not only check OS of iron, but also check OS of C5H5 fragment. The
corresponding regular Gaussian input file is examples\Ferrocene.gjf, run it yourself to obtain
corresponding .fch file, then load it into Multiwfn and perform orbital localization first as shown
above, after that enter LOBA/mLOBA analysis interface and input below commands:
-1 // Define fragment
1-5,7-11 // Index of the atoms constituting the C5H5 fragment
50 // Percentage threshold for performing LOBA

Oxidation state of the fragment:

-1

In this system the OS of Fe is +2, which is again reasonable. From the output it is seen that the
OS of individual carbons are not useful, however, the OS of the whole C5H5 fragment is a
meaningful value -1.
Next, we input m to check result of mLOBA method, you will find the OSs of Zn and C5H5
fragment are exactly the same as LOBA. Clearly using mLOBA is preferred over LOBA, because
you do not need to worry about how to set a proper threshold.
Finally, we study OS of carbon. The OS of all carbons obtained by LOBA is 2, which is clearly
incorrect, because each carbon does not bond to any atom that has electronegativity more negative
than it, so OS of carbon should not be positive. mLOBA gives different OSs for different carbons,
namely 4, 2 or -2, this inacceptable result is caused by the symmetry of ferrocene. The correct way
of using mLOBA to derive OS of carbons is first defining all the equivalent 10 carbons as a fragment
(atoms 1-3,7,8,12-16), then after inputting m, you will find the OS of the fragment given by mLOBA
is -12, and thus each carbon has OS of -12/10 = -1.2. Notice that although OS is usually an integer,
for the current system we have to accept non-integer OS, otherwise the sum of all OSs will not equal
the net charge of the system. If integer OS of carbon is needed, it may be reasonable to view it as 1, because -1 is the closest integer of -1.2.

4.8.5 Quantifying extent of spatial delocalization of orbitals via orbital
delocalization index (ODI)
Note: Chinese version of this section is my blog article “Using orbital delocalization index (ODI) to measure
spatial delocalization extent of orbitals” (http://sobereva.com/525).

When Multiwfn outputs composition of various atoms in an orbital, the orbital delocalization
index (ODI) is also printed. The ODI was defined by me, the value for orbital i is expressed as

ODIi = 0.01   ( A,i )2
A

where A,i is composition of atom A in orbital i.
The ODI a useful indicator of quantifying extent of orbital spatial delocalization, the lower
(higher) the ODI, the stronger the orbital delocalization (localization).
If you are familiar with Pipek-Mezey orbital localization method, you can easily understand idea of the ODI.
As a very simple instance, we consider two orbitals. The first one is fully localized on an atom, while another one is
equally distributed on two atoms, then the ODI for the first orbital will be (1002)/100=100, while that for the second
orbital will be (502+502)/100=50. Since the latter is much smaller than the former, the second orbital is much more
delocalized than the first one.

In addition, Multiwfn is able to calculate spatial delocalization index (SDI) to study extent of
orbital spatial delocalization, see Section 3.200.19 for introduction and Section 4.200.19 for
example. SDI can also study spatial delocalization of arbitrary real space function and thus much
more universal than ODI.

4.8.5.1 Example of calculating ODI based on orbital composition
In this section, I will take a practical molecule to demonstrate its usefulness and reliability.
Boot up Multiwfn and input
examples\excit\D-pi-A.fchk

4 Tutorials and Examples
8 // Orbital composition analysis
1 // Mulliken method
52 // Analyze MO 52
You will find below output, namely the ODI of MO 52 calculated by Mulliken method is 44.28
Orbital delocalization index:

44.28

Similarly, we compute and record ODI for MO 16, MO 53, MO 55, MO 56, MO 62. Note that
only MO62 is a virtual orbital.
For comparison purpose, we also calculate the ODI based on Hirshfeld orbital composition
analysis method. Input below commands
0 // Return
8 // Hirshfeld method
1 // Use built-in atomic density
52 // Analyze MO52
The output is
Orbital delocalization index:

38.93

Similarly, we use the Hirshfeld method to compute and record ODI for MO 16, MO 53, MO
55, MO 56, MO 62.
The isosurfaces of the analyzed MOs under isovalue of 0.04 are summarized below, the red
and blue texts correspond to the ODI calculated by Mulliken and Hirshfeld methods, respectively.

By comparing the ODI values and orbital isosurface maps it can be seen that the ODI value is
indeed able to faithfully quantify extent of orbital delocalization. The MO 16 is essentially a core
orbital of a carbon atom, since it is fully localized, the ODI nearly reaches its theoretical upper limit
(100). The MO 52 shows partial delocalization character, the two oxygens mainly and equally
contribute to the orbital, therefore its ODI is not quite high. The MO 55 corresponds to  orbital of
a ring and thus evidently distributes on more than two atoms, this is why its ODI is lower than MO
52. The MO 53 and MO 56 show strong global delocalization character, therefore their ODI values
are quite low. Because their ODI values are comparable, it can be concluded that MO 53 and MO

581

4 Tutorials and Examples
56 have similar extent of spatial delocalization.
The virtual orbital MO 62 is quite worth to mention, it is essentially a Rydberg orbital and its
main body surrounds the amino group. From the isosurface map it can be seen that MO 62 and MO
55 have comparable delocalization character, the ODI computed by Hirshfeld method for the two
orbitals (18.4 vs. 18.2) is in line with this observation. However, the ODI of MO 62 computed by
Mulliken method is much larger than MO 55, this is totally contrary to reality, showing the fact that
Mulliken (and its variant, SCPA and Stout-Politzer) is usually unreliable in calculating ODI for
virtual orbitals.
Also bear in mind that since Mulliken, SCPA and Stout-Politzer are incompatible with diffuse
functions, they should not be used to evaluate ODI when diffuse functions are present, in this case
you should use e.g. Hirshfeld and NAO methods instead.
In summary, I suggest using Hirshfeld method to compute ODI, it works well for any case.
However, if you only need to analyze occupied orbitals and diffuse function is not employed, you
can also use Mulliken or SCPA method, which is faster than Hirshfeld method for large system.

4.8.5.2 Calculating ODI based on orbital composition for a batch of orbitals
The Hirshfeld, Hirshfeld-I and Becke orbital composition analysis module is able to directly
calculate ODI for a batch of orbitals. For instance, here we calculate ODI for all occupied MOs for
the D--A system we studied above.
Boot up Multiwfn and input

From this graph we can very quickly identify the orbitals showing significant delocalization
character. The first 16 MOs in this system are core orbitals, as can be seen from the map, they are
much more localized than valence orbitals. The graph exhibits that MOs 50, 51 and 52 are also
highly localized, if you inspect their isosurface maps via main function 0, you will find they mainly
localize over the nitro group.

4.8.5.3 Calculating ODI for a fragment
In order to measure orbital delocalization extent on a specific fragment, I defined fragment
ODI:

 
ODI = 0.01    A,i 
Afrag  pi 
pi = 0.01    A,i

2

frag
i

Afrag

where p is normalization factor to account for the difference of total amount of orbital distribution
on different fragments. If the fragment contains all atoms, then the ODIfrag will be identical to the
aforementioned ODI.
Clearly, fragment ODI is very useful if you want to quantitatively compare orbital
delocalization for a fragment shared by analogues. Currently, only Hirshfeld, Hirshfeld-I and Becke
orbital composition analysis modules can calculate fragment ODI. Now, let see an example.
As vividly shown in the orbital isosurface maps of the D-pi-A.fchk given above, for the amino
group, the MO 53 fully localizes on the nitrogen atom, while the MO 56 delocalizes over the entire
group. Now we use fragment ODI to quantify this point. Boot up Multiwfn and input
examples\excit\D-pi-A.fchk
8 // Orbital composition analysis
8 // Hirshfeld method
-9 // Define fragment
24-26 // Index of the atoms in the amino group
Next, if you input 53, you will see
Fragment contribution:

Orbital delocalization index of the fragment:

77.26

if inputting 62, you will see
Fragment contribution:

71.819%

Orbital delocalization index of the fragment:

33.41

Since fragment ODI of MO 62 is significantly smaller than that of MO 53, it is clear that
delocalization of MO 62 over amino group is much stronger than MO 53.
Note that you can also use the option "Print orbital delocalization index (ODI) for a batch of
orbitals" to calculate ODI and ODIfrag for a batch of orbitals. The ODI values will be printed
followed by ODIfrag values.

4.8.6 Calculate orbital composition contributed by AIM basins and
other type of basins
As mentioned in Section 3.10.7, Multiwfn is able to compute orbital composition based on
AIM partition via basin analysis module (main function 17), in other words, calculate orbital
composition contributed by AIM basins. In addition, due to the extremal flexibility of the basin
analysis module, it is also possible to calculate orbital composition contributed by other kinds of
basins, such as ELF basins, electrostatic potential basins and Fukui function basins. In this section,
I will take CH3COCl as example to illustrate this point. You can use any kind of file as input file as
long as it contains GTF information, see Section 2.6 for more information.
If you are not familiar with basin analysis and find difficulty in understanding below examples, you are
suggested to read Section 3.20 to gain basic knowledge about basin analysis and check Section 4.17 to familiarize
yourself with the use of basin analysis module.

Calculate contributions of AIM basins to molecular orbitals
Boot up Multiwfn and input
examples\CH3COCl.wfn // You can also use other formats, e.g. wfx/fch/molden/mwfn... Note
that .wfn and .wfx only contain occupied orbitals
17 // Basin analysis
1 // Generate basins and locate attractors
1 // Use electron density to partition basins, namely yielding AIM basins
2 // Medium quality grid
11 // Calculate orbital compositions contributed by various basins
Now you can directly input index of an orbital to calculate its composition. For example, we
input 5, you will see

As you can see, Multiwfn first outputs contributions from various basins, and then, in order to
facilitate inspection, the contributions are outputted again according to the order of atoms
(commonly AIM basins and atoms have a one-to-one correspondence). If you use Hirshfeld method
to compute the composition of this orbital, you will find the result is similar; for example, Cl7 is
69.6% and C5 is 16.3%. Since generation of AIM basins is quite time-consuming for large system,
while AIM partition does not have special advantage, usually I recommend to use Hirshfeld or
Becke method to compute atomic contribution.
In the present interface, you can also use option -9 to define a set of atoms as fragment, so that
the fragment contribution can be outputted together. Besides, you can use option -4 to output all
atomic contributions in all orbitals to orbcomp.txt in current folder.
Calculate contributions of ELF basins to molecular orbitals
This time we will partition molecular space based on ELF, so that contributions from various
ELF basins to specific orbital can be obtained. Since each ELF basin usually corresponds to a local
region with featured electronic structure, this analysis may be useful in characterizing orbitals.
