3.17 Adaptive natural density partitioning (AdNDP)
analysis (14)
3.17.1 Theory
Famous NBO analysis developed by Weinhold and coworkers is able to recover up to 3-centers
2-electrons (3c-2e) orbitals from density matrix (e.g. by using "3cbond" keyword in NBO program).
Adaptive natural density partitioning (AdNDP), which was proposed by Boldyrev et al. (Phys. Chem.
Chem. Phys., 10, 5207 (2008)), may be viewed as a natural extension of NBO analysis aiming for
locating N>3 centers orbitals. AdNDP has been extensively used to study electronic structure
characteristic of widespread of cluster systems, by googling "AdNDP" you can find many related
literatures.
Canonical molecular orbitals (CMOs) are generally highly delocalized, often lacking of
chemical significances; While 2c or 3c NBOs are substantially localized, for highly conjugated
system resonant description is often needed (otherwise large non-Lewis composition will occur, that
means current system is inappropriate to be portrayed by single set of NBOs), this somewhat
conflicts with modern quantum chemistry concepts and obscures delocalization natural of electrons
in conjugated system. AdNDP orbitals seamlessly bridged CMOs and NBOs, AdNDP bonding
patterns avoid resonant description and are always consistent with the point symmetry of the
molecule.
The basic idea of AdNDP to generate multi-center orbitals is very similar to NBO analysis, that
is constructing proper sub-block of density matrix in natural atomic orbital (NAO) basis and then
diagonalize it, the eigenvalues and eigenvectors correspond to occupation number and orbital
wavefunction respectively. For example, we want to generate all possible 4-centers orbitals for atom
A,B,C,D, we first pick out corresponding sub-blocks and then combine them to together:

 PA, A
P

( A, B ,C , D )

After diagonalization of P(A,B,C,D), if one or more eigenvalues exceeded the predefined threshold,
which is commonly set to close to 2.0 (e.g. 1.7), then corresponding orbitals will be regarded as
candidate 4c-2e bonds. Completely identical strategy can be used to generate orbitals with higher
number of centers.
Indeed, the orbital generating process of AdNDP is quite easy once atom combination is
determined, however the searching process of final Nc-2e orbitals in entire system is complicated,
manual inspections and operations are necessary. AdNDP approach has large ambiguity, it is
possible that the searching process carried out by different peoples finally results in different AdNDP
pattern, I think this is the most serious limitation of current AdNDP approach. So, AdNDP is never
a black box, before using it users must have preliminary understanding of the searching process of
the AdNDP implemented in Multiwfn.
Before the search, densities from core-type NAOs are automatically eliminated from the
density matrix, since they have no any contribution to bonding. After that, 1-center orbitals (lone

pair), 2-centers orbitals, 3-centers orbitals, 4-centers orbitals ... will be searched in turn, until
residual density (trace of density matrix) is close to zero. The search could be exhaustive, that means
when searching N-centers orbitals, Multiwfn will construct and diagonalize M!/(M-N)!/N! subblocks of density matrix, where M is the total number of atoms. All of the orbitals whose occupation
numbers are larger than the threshold will be added to candidate orbital list. For large system, the
searching process may be very time-consuming or even forbidden, for example, exhaustive search
of 10-centers orbitals in the system with 30 atoms needs to construct and diagonalize 30045015 subblocks of density matrix! This is very difficult to be finished in personal computer, for such case,
user-directed searching is necessary. In Multiwfn you can define a search list, then the exhaustive
search will only apply to the atoms in the search list, so that the amount of computation would be
greatly reduced. You can also directly let Multiwfn construct and diagonalize sub-block of density
matrix for specified atom combination. Note that user-directed searching has relatively high
requirements of skill and experience on users.
Once the search of N-centers orbitals is finished, we will get a list containing candidate Ncenters orbitals. We need to pick some of them out as final N-centers AdNDP orbitals. Commonly,
one or more orbitals with the highest occupation numbers will be picked out. Notice that, since some
densities are simultaneously shared by multiple candidate orbitals, if we directly pick out several
candidate orbitals with the largest occupation at one time, the electrons may be overcounted. To
avoid this problem, assume that K orbitals with the highest occupation numbers obviously overlap
with some other candidate orbitals meanwhile there is no evident overlapping between the K orbitals,
we should first pick out K orbitals as final AdNDP orbitals, then Multiwfn will automatically deplete
their density from the density matrix and then reconstruct and diagonalize the corresponding subblocks of density matrix for remained candidate orbitals to update their shapes and occupation
numbers. If there are still some candidate orbitals with occupation numbers close to 2.0, you may
consider picking them out, then remained orbitals will be updated again. Such process may be
repeated several times until there is no orbitals have high occupation numbers. After that, you can
start to search N+1 centers orbitals.
The general requirements of AdNDP analysis are that: The final residual density (corresponds
to non-Lewis composition in NBO analysis) should as low as possible; the occupation numbers of
each AdNDP orbital should as close to 2.0 as possible; the number of centers of AdNDP orbitals
should as less as possible; the resulting orbitals must be consistent with molecular symmetry.
However, there is no unique rule on how to search orbitals and pick out candidate orbitals as
AdNDP orbitals. For example, one can first search 5-centers orbitals before completing search of 3centers orbitals, and one can also directly search 6-centers orbitals after the search of 2-centers
orbitals has finished. The sequence of picking out candidate orbitals is also not necessarily always
in accordance to magnitude of occupation numbers. The final AdNDP pattern obtained by different
operations may be different, how to do AdNDP analysis is largely dependent on users themselves.
Actually some molecules may have two or even more equally reasonable AdNDP patterns,
sometimes it is difficult to discriminate which pattern is the best. I have confidence to say that some
AdNDP patterns presented in published papers are not the optimal ones. The experience of using
AdNDP approach can be gradually accumulated in practices and during reading related literatures.
AdNDP is very insensitive to basis set quality as NBO analysis, 6-31G* is enough to produce
accurate results for main group elements in the first few rows. Over enhancing basis set quality will
not improve AdNDP analysis results but only lead to increase of the computational burden in

diagonalization step, since the size of sub-block of density matrix is directly determined by size of
basis set.
Multiwfn offers capacity of evaluating AdNDP orbital energies. You need to provide a file
containing Fock (or Kohn-Sham) matrix in original basis functions. The Fock matrix can be obtained
from output of Gaussian or other programs. The energy of AdNDP orbital is corresponding diagonal
term of Fock matrix in AdNDP orbital representation. Specifically, Multiwfn performs below
representation transform:

FAdNDP = CT FAO C

C = X AONAOc

where FAO is the Fock matrix in original basis function that loaded from user-provided file, C(r,i)
corresponds to coefficient of basis function r in AdNDP orbital i. c(s,i) corresponds to coefficient of
NAO s in AdNDP orbital i. XAONAO is transformation matrix between original basis function and
NAO, i.e. X(t,s) is coefficient of basis function t in NAO s. Energy of AdNDP orbital j is simply
FAdNDP(j,j), which is expectation value of Fock operator of AdNDP orbital wavefunction.

3.17.2 Input file
The output file of NBO program containing density matrix in NAO basis (DMNAO) can be
used as input file for AdNDP analysis. If you also need to visualize AdNDP orbitals or export orbitals
as cube files, .fch file must be provided, meanwhile transformation matrix between NAO and
original basis functions (AONAO) must be presented in the NBO output file.
Assume that you are a Gaussian user, in order to obtain a Gaussian output file containing all
information needed by Multiwfn to perform the AdNDP analysis and visualization, you should write
a Gaussian input file of single point task with pop=nboread keyword in route section, and write
$NBO AONAO DMNAO $END after molecular geometry section with a blank line as separator.
Then run the input file by Gaussian and then convert .chk file to .fch format by formchk utility.
The Gaussian output file (not .fch file) should be used as the initial input file when Multiwfn
boots up. Once you entered AdNDP module, Multiwfn will load NAO information and DMNAO
matrix from this file. If then you choose corresponding options to visualize or export orbitals,
AONAO matrix will be loaded and the program will prompt you to input the path of the .fch file
(if .fch is in the same folder and has identical name as the Gaussian output file, then the .fch will be
automatically loaded).
Multiwfn is also compatible with the output files of stand-alone NBO program (GENNBO), of
course you have to add DMNAO keywords in $NBO section in .47 file. In this case it is impossible
to visualize AdNDP orbitals.
Formally, AdNDP approach is also applicable to open-shell systems; of course, the occupation
threshold should be divided by 2. When you enter AdNDP module, Multiwfn will ask you which
density matrix should be used, the so-called total density matrix is the sum of alpha and beta density
matrix.
Notice that if after you entered AdNDP module Multiwfn suddenly crashes, and the basis set
you used contains diffuse functions, you can try to use another basis set without diffuse functions.
This problem is caused by the bug in NBO 3.1 module, namely in rarely cases the DMNAO output
may be slightly problematic if diffuse functions present. Since AdNDP analysis is quite insensitive
to diffuse functions, they can be safely removed without any loss of accuracy.
If you want to obtain AdNDP orbital energies, Fock matrix corresponding to present system at

the same calculation level must be provided in lower-triangular sequence in a plain text file, namely:
F(1,1) F(2,1) F(2,2) F(3,1) F(3,2) F(3,3) ... F(nbasis,nbasis), where nbasis is the total number of
basis functions. The format is free. If you are a Gaussian user, you can add archive file=XXX
keyword between $NBO ... $END, then in the resulting XXX.47 file, search $FOCK and copy all
data between $FOCK ... $END to a plain text file, then this file can be directly used to provide Fock
matrix to Multiwfn (In fact, Multiwfn is also able to automatically locate and read the $FOCK field
when the file name has .47 suffix).

3.17.3 Options
All of the options involved in AdNDP module are introduced below, some options are invisible
in certain cases. If current candidate orbital list is not empty, then all candidate orbitals will always
be printed on screen in front of the menu (except when you select option 5 or 13), the candidate
orbital indices are determined according to occupation numbers. The number of residual valence
electrons of all atoms in the search list is always printed at the upper of the menu, this value
decreases with gradually picking out candidate orbitals as final AdNDP orbitals. If this value is very
low (e.g. lower than 1.4), it is suggested that new Nc-2e AdNDP orbitals will be impossible to be
found between the atoms in the search list.
-10 Return to main menu: Once you choose this option, you will return to main menu,
meantime all results of AdNDP analysis will be lost. Hence the status of AdNDP module can be
reset by choosing this option and then re-entering the module.
-2 Various other settings and functions: This options have several unimportant subfunctions
and settings. The option "Set maximum number of candidate orbitals to be printed" is worth to
mention, it is used to set how many candidate orbitals will be printed on screen, proper choice of
the threshold can avoid excessive output when very large number of candidates are found.
-1 Define exhaustive search list: In this option, one can define a search list, exhaustive search
(option 2) will only apply to the atoms in the search list. All commands in this defining interface are
self-explanatory. Notice that default search list includes all atoms of the molecule.
0 Pick out some candidate orbitals and update occupations of others: This is used to pick
out orbitals from candidate list to actual AdNDP orbital list. As shown by prompt on screen, user
can input indices of the orbitals to picked out. For convenience, if user only inputs one number, e.g.
5, then 5 candidate orbitals with largest occupation numbers will be picked out. After that, the
eigenvectors (orbital shape) and eigenvalues (occupation numbers) of remained candidate orbitals
will be updated as mentioned earlier.
1 Perform orbitals search for a specific atom combination: Users need to input indices of
some atoms, e.g. 3,4,5,8,9, then sub-block of density matrix for atom 3,4,5,8,9 will be constructed
and diagonalized, all resultant eigenvectors will be added to candidate orbitals list, meantime all
previous candidate orbitals will be removed. There is no limit on the number of inputted atoms.
2 Perform exhaustive search of N-centers orbitals within the search list: N atoms will be
selected out from the search list in an exhaustive manner, assume that the search list contains M
atoms, then totally M!/(M-N)!/N! atom combinations will be formed. For each combination,
corresponding sub-block of density matrix will be constructed and diagonalized, all eigenvectors
with eigenvalues larger than user-defined threshold will be added to candidate orbital list. Old
candidate orbital list will be cleaned.
3 Set the number of centers in the next exhaustive search: Namely set the value N in option

2. Once exhaustive search of N-centers orbitals is finished, N will be automatically increased by one.
4 Set occupation threshold in the next exhaustive search: Namely set the threshold used in
option 2.
5 Show information of AdNDP orbitals: Print occupation numbers and involved atoms of all
saved AdNDP orbitals.
6 Delete some AdNDP orbitals: Input two numbers, e.g. i, j, then saved AdNDP orbitals from
i to j will be removed.
7 Visualize AdNDP orbitals and molecular geometry: The path of corresponding .fch file
will be prompted to be inputted, after loading some necessary information from the file, a GUI
window will pop up and molecular geometry will be shown. Isosurfaces of AdNDP orbitals can be
plotted by clicking corresponding numbers in the right-bottom list
8 Visualize candidate orbitals and molecular geometry: Analogous to option 7, but used to
visualize isosurfaces of candidate orbitals. It is useful to visualize the isosurfaces before picking out
some candidate orbitals as final AdNDP orbitals.
9 Export some AdNDP orbitals to Gaussian-type cube files: User need to choose grid setting
and then input index range, e.g. 2-4, then wavefunction value of AdNDP orbitals 2, 3, 4 will be
calculated and exported to AdNDPorb0002.cub, AdNDPorb0003.cub and AdNDPorb0004.cub in
current folder, respectively. They are Gaussian-type cube files and can be visualized by many
softwares such as VMD.
10 Export some candidate orbitals to Gaussian-type cube files: Analogous to option 9, but
used to export cube files for candidate orbitals.
11/12 Save/Load current density matrix and AdNDP orbital list: Option 11 is used to save
current density matrix and AdNDP orbital list in memory temporarily, when density matrix and
AdNDP orbital list is changed, you can choose option 12 to recover previous state.
13 Show residual density distributions on the atoms in the search list: After choosing this
option, population number of each atom in the search list will be calculated according to present
density matrix and then printed out. If some neighboring atoms have large population number, it is
suggested that multi-center orbitals with high occupation number may appear on these atoms; while
the atoms with low population number often can be ignored in the following searching process.
Thus this option is very helpful for setting up user-directed searching.
14 Export AdNDP orbitals to .mwfn file: Via this option, all picked AdNDP orbitals will be
exported as AdNDP.mwfn in current folder (see Section 2.5 for introduction of .mwfn format). By
using this file as input file, you can perform various kinds of analyses for AdNDP orbitals (e.g.
orbital composition analysis by main function 8, plotting plane map via main function 4). Note that
if there are N basis functions and M AdNDP orbitals have been picked out, then the first M orbitals
in the AdNDP.mwfn will correspond to the AdNDP orbitals, while the other N-M orbitals in this file
are meaningless and can be simply ignored.
15 Evaluate and output composition of AdNDP orbitals: This option is used to calculate
orbital composition of picked AdNDP orbitals by natural atomic orbital (NAO) method, which has
been introduced in Section 3.10.4.
16 Evaluate and output energy of AdNDP orbitals: This function is used to evaluate energy
of AdNDP orbitals that have already been picked out. Multiwfn will prompt you to input the path of
the file containing Fock matrix in original basis functions, the elements of the matrix should be
recorded in lower-triangular sequence, the NBO .47 file containing $FOCK field can also be directly
