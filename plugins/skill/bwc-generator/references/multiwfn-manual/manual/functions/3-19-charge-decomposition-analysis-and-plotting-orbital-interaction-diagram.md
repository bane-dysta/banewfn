(3) Enter main function 15, choose the weighting function you want to use by option -1.
(4) Choose option 13. Multiwfn will ask you to input path of wavefunction file of each kind
of element involved in the present system, the corresponding density will be used to
evaluate Vfree. After inputting the paths, calculation will be started.
During calculation, you can see Veff, Vfree and their ratio Veff/Vfree are printed for each atom.
TS
Once the calculation is completely finished, Multiwfn will print eff (0), % and 𝐶6,𝐴𝐴
for all atoms.
Note that the free (0) used for their evaluations come from the recommended values in CTCP
atomic polarizability table (http://ctcp.massey.ac.nz/index.php?menu=dipole&page=dipole, data of
free
Nov 16, 2020 version was taken). The built-in 𝐶6,𝐴𝐴
comes from J. Chem. Phys., 121, 4083 (2004),
free
the value of H comes from Table I of original paper of TS method. Only the 𝐶6,𝐴𝐴
values of elements
of the first five rows except for Zr-Cd are available, other elements have zero value.
If you only need aforementioned data for certain atoms in the system, you can use option -5 to
define an atom list first, then other atoms will not be involved in the calculation of option 13.
It is worth to note that if you choose to construct atomic weighting functions by Hirshfeld or Hirshfeld-I method
in the way that manually providing atomic wavefunction files, these atomic wavefunction files are completely
irrelevant to those used to evaluate Vfree. The former must correspond to sphericalized density, while this requirement
is dispensable for the latter.

An example of using this function is given in Section 4.15.4.

3.19 Charge decomposition analysis and plotting orbital
interaction diagram (16)
3.19.1 Theory
The charge decomposition analysis (CDA) proposed by Dapprich and Frenking (J. Phys.
Chem., 99, 9352 (1995)) is used to provide deep insight on how charges are transferred between
fragments in a complex to achieve charge equilibrium. The idea of CDA is based on fragment orbital
(FO), which denotes the molecular orbital (MO) of fragment in its isolated state. Besides, once the
compositions of FOs in MOs of complex are obtained, the orbital interaction diagram can be directly
plotted, which allows one visually and directly understand how orbitals of fragments are mixed to
form orbitals of complex.
For simplicity, in this section we assume that the complex consists of only two fragments. The
CDA can also be straightforwardly employed for more than two fragments cases.
Fragment orbitals
Consider we are studying a complex AB, NA basis functions are located in the atoms of
fragment A, NB basis functions in fragment B, then each MO of complex will be linearly expanded
by NA+NB basis functions, and meanwhile, the complex has NA+NB MOs. By using the same basis
set, and maintaining the same geometry as in complex, if we calculate the two fragments respectively,
we can obtain NA MOs of fragment A, and NB MOs of fragment B, they are collectively called as
fragment orbital (FO). We can take these FOs as basis functions to linearly expand the MOs of
complex. Since the dimension (the number of basis functions) is still NA+NB, the expansion is exact.

In other words, we equivalently transformed the basis.
Charge decomposition analysis
In the original paper of CDA, the authors defined three terms:
occ vir

d i = i C m ,i Cn ,i S m ,n
mA nB
vir occ

bi = i C m ,i Cn ,i S m ,n
mA nB
occ occ

ri = i C m ,i C n ,i S m ,n
mA nB

where i and η are index and occupation number of MO of complex, respectively.

Sm,n =   m (r) n (r)d r is overlap integral between FO m and FO n. Note that though the NA and
NB FOs are respectively orthonormal sets, the NA set are in common not normal to the NB set, so S
is not an identity matrix. Cm,i denotes the coefficient of FO m in MO i of complex. The superscript
"vir" and "occ" mean virtual (viz. unoccupied) and occupied, respectively.
The term di denotes the amount of electron donated from fragment A to B via MO i of complex;
similarly, the term bi denotes the electron back donated from B to A. In fact, iCm,iCn,iSm,n can be
regarded as the half of overlap population between FO m and n in MO i. Hence, the difference
between term d and b is that which fragment provides its electrons from its occupied FOs to virtual
FOs of another fragment. The term r reveals closed-shell interaction between two occupied FOs in
different fragments; positive value of ri means that owing to MO i, the electrons of the two fragments
are accumulated in their overlap region and shows bonding character, while negative value indicates
that the electrons are depleted from the overlap region and thus reflecting electron repulsive effect.
The sum of all ri terms is in general negative, because overall interaction between filled orbitals are
generally repulsive. r is also known as "repulsion polarization" term
Beware that although the CDA formulae given in original paper are correct, by carefully
inspecting the data, I found the d, b and r terms in the examples presented in the original paper are
erroneous (the data should be divided by two).
Generalization of CDA
The original definition of CDA has two drawbacks. First, it is only applicable to closed-shell
cases (namely, complex and each fragment must be closed-shell) and hence unable to be used when
the two fragments are bound by covalent bonding. Second, in post-HF calculations, though the MOs
of complex can be replaced by natural orbitals (NOs), the FOs can only be produced by HF or DFT
calculation, because occupation numbers of FOs are not explicitly considered in the original CDA
formulae.
To address the limitations of the original definition, in my paper J. Adv. Phys. Chem., 4, 111124 (2015) (http://dx.doi.org/10.12677/JAPC.2015.44013) I proposed a generalized form of CDA,
which is the form used in CDA module of Multiwfn:

ri =  2

mFO − nFO
 ref

Cm ,i Cn ,i S m ,n

min( mFO , nFO )

 ref

i Cm,i Cn ,i S m,n

In the generalized CDA, orbitals of complex and fragments can be produced either by HF/DFT or
by post-HF method, corresponding to MOs and NOs, respectively. FO
stands for occupation
𝑚
number of FO m. For open-shell cases, ηref is 1.0, CDA will be performed for alpha spin and beta
spin separately; for the former, i denotes alpha orbital of complex, m and n run over all alpha FOs;
for the latter, i denotes beta orbital of complex, m and n run over all beta FOs. For closed-shell cases,
ηref is 2.0, m and n run over space orbitals. min() is the function used to extract minimum from two
values. During calculation of t, if the values are only accumulated for the cases FO
> FO
, then the
𝑚
𝑛
FO
FO
resulting t is d; if only for the cases 𝑚 < 𝑛 , then t will be b.
For the situations when the original CDA is applicable, the b and d calculated by the generalized
form are exactly identical to the ones obtained via original definition; while r will be exactly twice
of the one produced via original definition. The reason why the factor 2 is introduced into the
generalized form of r is because after doing so, r has more clear physical meaning, namely it equals
to overlap population (also known as Mulliken bond order) between the occupied FOs in the two
fragments.
Because the CDA has been generalized, below, FO will stand for MO or NO of fragment,
"complex orbital" will denote MO or NO of complex. The orbitals can either be spin-space orbital
(for open-shell) or space orbital (for closed-shell).
It is clear that the d, b and r terms can be decomposed into FO pair contributions, this kind of
decomposition is supported by Multiwfn and greatly facilitates analysis of the nature of FO
interaction.
Composition of FO in complex orbital and orbital interaction diagram
By using the methods discussed in Section 3.10, the composition of FO in complex orbital can
be calculated. In common, Mulliken method is the best choice for this purpose, the composition of
FO m in complex orbital i is calculated as



m,i =  Cm2 ,i +  Cm,i Cn ,i S m,n   100%
n m


Note that due to a well-known drawback of Mulliken method, sometimes negative contributions
may occur. Since the negative values are often not large, you can simply view them as zero. In
addition, sometimes contribution may be slightly larger than 100%, you can simply view it as 100%.
Using SCPA method instead of Mulliken method to compute the composition is also supported, you
just need to change “iCDAcomp” in settings.ini to 2. The advantage of SCPA over Mulliken is that
the composition will never exceed 100%, and it is always positive. However, if i is a high-lying
virtual orbital, the calculated composition may be not very reasonable.
From Θ, we can clearly understand how each complex orbital is formed by mixing FOs of the
two fragments. Furthermore, one can plot orbital interaction diagram to visually and intuitively
study the relationship between complex orbitals and FOs, namely plot a bar for each complex orbital
and FO according to its energy, and then check each Θ to determine how to link the bars, e.g. if the
value of Θm,i is larger than 5%, then the two bars corresponding to FO m and complex orbital i will

be linked. Consequently, from the graph we will directly know that FO m has important contribution
to complex orbital i.
Extended charge decomposition analysis (ECDA)
The difference between the total number of donation and back donation electrons, that is d - b,
may be regarded as the net transferred electrons. However, in J. Am. Chem. Soc., 128, 278 (2006),
the authors argued that this viewpoint is not correct, because b and d terms not only represent charge
transfer effect (CT), but also electron polarization effect (PL); the latter describes the adjustment of
electron distribution within the fragment, which is caused by mixing virtual and occupied FOs of
the same fragment during formation of the complex, and should be excluded in the calculation of
the amount of net transferred electrons. In this paper they proposed extended charge decomposition
analysis (ECDA) method, by which they argued that the number of net transferred electrons can be
calculated more reasonably.
In ECDA viewpoint, four terms can be defined as follows
1. PL(A) + CT(A→B) = The sum of compositions of occupied FOs of fragment A in all virtual
orbitals of complex, multiplied by Occ
2. PL(A) + CT(B→A) = The sum of compositions of virtual FOs of fragment A in all occupied
orbitals of complex, multiplied by Occ
3. PL(B) + CT(B→A) = The sum of compositions of occupied FOs of fragment B in all virtual
orbitals of complex, multiplied by Occ
4. PL(B) + CT(A→B) = The sum of compositions of virtual FOs of fragment B in all occupied
orbitals of complex, multiplied by Occ
where Occ is 1.0 and 2.0 for open-shell and closed-shell cases, respectively.
After the four terms are calculated, the number of net transferred electrons from fragment A to
B can be directly obtained as
CT(A→B) - CT(B→A) = [ PL(A) + CT(A→B) ] - [ PL(A) + CT(B→A) ]
The composition of complex orbitals can be calculated by various methods, leading to different
ECDA result. The method used in Multiwfn is identical to the one in ECDA original paper, namely
Mulliken method.
Note that ECDA can neither be applied to post-HF calculation nor the system consisting of
more than two fragments. ECDA can also not be used when SCPA is employed to evaluate orbital
composition.
According to the name, ECDA is as if an extension of CDA, however in my personal opinion,
ECDA is irrelevant to CDA, their basic ideas are quite different, and thus the amount of net
transferred electron calculated by ECDA is not comparable with the d - b produced by CDA at all.
In addition, though ECDA is realized in Multiwfn, I do not think this is a useful method. The most
remarkable feature of CDA is that the electron transfer can be decomposed to contribution of
complex orbitals, however ECDA is incapable to do this; ECDA can only reveal how many electrons
is transferred between two fragments, but this quantity actually can be obtained by a more
straightforward approach, namely calculating the fragment charge by summing up all atomic
charges in the fragment, and then subtracting it by the net charge of the fragment in its isolated state.

3.19.2 Input file
CDA analysis can be carried out as long as you have file containing basis function information

for complex and all fragments. As described in Section 2.5, .mwfn, .fch, .gms, .molden can be used
as input file in this case.
Below requirements on input files should be noticed:
(1) The method and basis set employed in the calculation of complex and fragments must be
the same, otherwise the result will be meaningless. For example, assume that you are preparing input
files of CDA analysis for a transition metal complex, if mixed basis set is employed for complex
calculation (e.g. Lanl2TZ for metal and 6-31G* for ligands), then in the fragment calculations,
Lanl2TZ must be used for the metal fragment, and 6-31G* must be used for the ligand fragment(s).
(2) The coordinate of each fragment in their wavefunction files must be exactly identical to the
coordinate in the complex wavefunction file.
In order to guarantee this, it is best to first optimize the complex (and meantime obtain its wavefunction file),
and then directly extract coordinates of various fragments from the optimized complex geometry and then write them
as individual input files of single point task (after calculating them you will obtain wavefunction files of the
fragments). Clearly, the fragments should never be optimized, otherwise their coordinates will become inconsistent
with the complex coordinate.

(3) The sequence of atoms in fragments and in complex must be identical, that means the actual
atom sequence in the complex can be retrieved by successively combining the atoms in fragment 1,
2, 3 ...
(4) Avoid employing diffuse functions whenever possible! According to my experiences, when
diffusion basis functions are presented, the CDA results are often unreasonable or even completely
meaningless.
"examples\CDA\COBH3_ORCA" folder contains example .molden files generated by ORCA
3.0.1 for performing CDA analysis of COBH3 system.
Special notes for Gaussian users
For Gaussian users, below points should be noted.
• Since Gaussian automatically puts the system in standard orientation, in order to satisfy the
above requirement (2), nosymm keyword should be used in the calculation to avoid this treatment.
• If you intent to use mixed basis set, and in particular Pople type basis set is involved (such as
6-31G*), it is best to specify 5d keyword in the fragment calculations to force Gaussian to use
spherical-harmonic type of basis functions for d shell.
• By default, Gaussian automatically eliminates linearly dependent basis functions, hence in
some cases (usually when diffuse functions are employed), the number of basis functions is not
equal to the number of orbitals, in this case CDA cannot be performed. Using IOp(3/32=2) can
avoid this problem.
• If you employed post-HF for complex and fragment calculations, you need to follow the steps
described at the beginning of Chapter 4 to save natural orbitals into .fch file.
Gaussian output file of single point task can also be used for CDA analysis. nosymm pop=full
must be employed in all cases, and IOp(3/33=1) should also be specified in the complex calculation.
Molecular geometry must be given in Cartesian coordinate. If you want to perform CDA analysis at
post-HF level, do not use pop=full but use density pop=NO and density pop=NOAB for closed-shell
and open-shell cases, respectively, so that coefficients of natural orbitals can be outputted.

3.19.3 Usage
After booting up Multiwfn, you should first input the path of the file of complex, and then enter
the CDA module. Next, you should set the number of fragments, and then input the path of the file

for each fragment in turn.
For open-shell fragments, you will be prompted to choose if flipping its electron spin. If you
select "y", then orbital information of its alpha and beta orbitals will be exchanged. The reason for
introduction of this step is clear: for example, we want to use CDA to decompose electron transfer
between fragment CH3 and NH2 in CH3NH2; CH3NH2 has 9 alpha and 9 beta electrons. However,
during calculation via quantum chemistry codes, both CH3 and NH2 will be regarded as having 5
alpha and 4 beta electrons. Therefore, in order to carry out CDA, we have to flip electron spin of
either CH3 or NH2, otherwise the total numbers of alpha and beta electrons in the two fragments,
namely 5+5=10 and 4+4=8, respectively, will be unequal to those of the complex, namely 9 and 9.
Once the loading is finished, Multiwfn starts to calculate some data. If only two fragments are
defined, CDA and ECDA result will be directly shown. Then you will see a menu:
-3 Set threshold of printing CDA result in option 0: Only the complex orbitals with
contribution to d or b or r term larger than the specified threshold in this option will be printed in
option 0. This option is useful to screen out insignificant complex orbitals in printing CDA result.
-2 Switch output destination (for options 0 and 1): By default, the options 0 and 1 output
results on screen; if you select this option once, then their results will be outputted to CDA.txt in
current folder.
0 Print CDA result and ECDA result: Input the index of two fragments, then the CDA and
ECDA analysis result between them will be outputted.
1 Print full CDA result: If you select this option, the CDA result for all complex orbitals will
be outputted. By default, Multiwfn does not output CDA result for the complex orbitals lying higher
than LUMO+5, because the number of such orbitals is too large, whereas their contributions to d, b
and r terms are often completely negligible due to their occupation numbers are often quite small.
(For HF/DFT wavefunctions, the occupation numbers of the orbitals lying higher than HOMO are
exactly zero, and thus have no contribution to d, b and r terms at all. So for this case this option is
meaningless)
2 Show fragment orbital contributions to specific complex orbital: If you input x, then the
composition of complex orbital x will be outputted (for open-shell cases, the xth alpha and the xth
beta complex orbital will be outputted respectively). By default only the FOs having contribution
1% will be shown, but this threshold can be altered by "compthresCDA" parameter in settings.ini.
If you want to obtain composition of a fragment orbital in all complex orbitals, you can input
for example 1,6, which means orbital 6 of fragment 1 is selected.
3 Export coefficient matrix of complex orbitals in fragment orbital basis: The coefficient
matrix corresponding to all FOs in all complex orbitals will be outputted to coFO.txt in current
folder.
4 Export overlap matrix between fragment orbitals: The overlap matrix between all FOs
will be outputted to ovlpint.txt in current folder.
6 Decompose complex orbital contribution to CDA: You need to input index of a complex
orbital and set threshold for printing, if contribution of a pair of fragmental orbitals to any of d, b
and r term of this complex orbital is larger than the threshold then the contribution value will be
shown. This greatly facilitates analysis of interaction between fragment orbitals.
5 Plot orbital interaction diagram: If you select this option, you will enter a new menu, in
which by corresponding options you can plot and save orbital interaction diagram and adjust plotting
parameters, such as size of labels, energy range (namely Y-axis range) and the criterion for linking

bars. The orbital interaction diagram plotted under default settings looks like this:

In above graph, occupied and virtual orbitals are represented as solid and dashed bars,
respectively, the vertical positions are determined by their energies. The bars at left and right sides
correspond to the FOs of the two fragments you selected; the bars in the middle correspond to
complex orbitals. Orbital indices are labelled by blue texts. If two or more labels occur in the same
bar, that means these orbitals are degenerate in energy. If composition of a FO in a complex orbital
is larger than specific criterion, then the corresponding two bars will be connected by red line, so
that simply by viewing the diagram one can directly understand the complex orbitals are constructed
by mainly mixing which FOs. The compositions are labelled in the center of the lines.
By default, all FOs and complex MOs are plotted, and if the contribution of a FO of fragment
A or B to a complex MO is larger than 10% then they will be connected. For large systems, usually
there are too many bars and linking lines in the diagram, and it is hence difficult to identify the
orbital interaction mode based on the diagram. In these cases, you should properly use the option "4
Set the rule for connecting and drawing orbital bars" to manually set up the rule for connecting and
plotting the orbital bars. See the prompt shown on the screen on how to use this option.
Sometimes the difference between orbital energies of the two fragments in the orbital
interaction diagram is too large and thus hinders one to analyze the diagram, so you may want to
equalize their energies. In this case, you can use the option "12 Set orbital energy shifting value" to
set the value used to shifting orbital energies of the complex or the two fragments presented at the
left and right side of the diagram; their orbital energies will be augmented by the given value.
Some notes
If complex or any fragment is an unrestricted open-shell system, then CDA will be performed
separately for alpha and beta electrons.
Files containing restricted open-shell wavefunction can also be used as input file for CDA
analysis, however, Multiwfn will deal with this situation in the same way as closed-shell case,
