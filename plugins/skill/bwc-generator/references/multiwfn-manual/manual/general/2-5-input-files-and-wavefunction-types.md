2 General information

2.3 Files of Multiwfn
You will find following files after uncompressing Multiwfn package, only the bolded files are
indispensable for running Multiwfn:
• Multiwfn.exe (Windows) or Multiwfn (Linux/Mac OS) : The executable file of Multiwfn.
• libiomp5md.dll (Windows) : Intel OpenMP Runtime library.
• settings.ini : All detail parameters for running Multiwfn are recorded here, most of them do
not need to be frequently modified. When booting up, Multiwfn will try to find and use this file in
current folder, if it is not presented in current folder, the file in the path defined by "Multiwfnpath"
environment variable will be used; if the file still cannot be found, default settings will be used
instead. If you run Multiwfn via command line, you can also directly specify position of this file via
"-set" argument, for example: Multiwfn test.wfn -set /sob/3.7/settings.ini.
The meanings of all parameters in settings.ini are not documented in this manual systematically,
since they have already been commented in detail, only those important will be mentioned in this
manual. I suggest you read through the settings.ini and find out the ones useful for you.
• “examples” folder : Some useful files, scripts and the files involved in the examples of
Chapter 4.
• LICENSE.txt : The terms that all users must follow.
• Multiwfn quick start.pdf : A short document lets new user immediately understand how to
use Multiwfn to carry out very common tasks.
• How to cite Multiwfn.pdf : Please properly cite Multiwfn according to this document.

2.4 Parallel implementation
Most time-consuming codes of Multiwfn have been parallelized by OpenMP technique. If your
CPU has multiple cores, you can greatly benefit from parallelization. To enable parallelization, just
modify “nthreads” parameter in settings.ini to a proper number. For example, your computer have
a CPU with 12-cores physical cores, then commonly you should change “nthreads” to 12.
If Multiwfn crashes during parallel calculation for a very large system, try to enlarge
“ompstacksize” in settings.ini (for Windows version) or enlarge the value of the environment
variable OMP_STACKSIZE (for Linux or Mac OS version).

2.5 Input files and wavefunction types
Wavefunction types supported by Multiwfn include restricted/unrestricted single-determinant
wavefunction, restricted open-shell wavefunction and post-HF wavefunction (in natural orbital
formalism).
Cartesian or spherical harmonic Gaussian functions with angular moment up to h are supported.
There is no upper limit of the number of atoms / basis functions / GTFs / orbitals in Multiwfn,
the actual upper limit is only decided by available memory in your computer.

2 General information
Multiwfn determines the input file type by file extension. Notice that different functions need
different types of information, you should choose proper type of input file, see the table below. For
example, the wavefunction represented by GTFs is enough for Hirshfeld population, so you can
use .mwfn/.fch/.molden/.gms/.31~.40/.wfn/.wfx file as input, but .pdb, .xyz, .mol, etc. do not carry
any wavefunction information hence cannot be used; in contrast, generating grid data of RDG
function with promolecular approximation only requires atom coordinates, so all supported file
formats can be used (except for plain text file). The requirement on information types by each
function is commonly described at the end of corresponding section in Chapter 3 by red text.

About ghost atom: In any wavefunction format described below, ghost atoms (the points with basis functions
but without nuclear charges) are allowed to occur. Their element indices should be 0, and if the file format records
element names, the ghost atom should have element name of Bq. Their nuclear charges are loaded by Multiwfn in
common way from the file, but of course, in principle they should be zero since they are ghost atoms.

Multiwfn wavefunction file (.mwfn): This format is defined and supported since Multiwfn
3.7. This is the most ideal format for wavefunction storage and exchange purposes. This file records
all information for wavefunction analysis in a strict, concise, compact and extensible format. The
introduction and definition of this format have been carefully described in my paper: ChemRxiv
(2020) DOI: 10.26434/chemrxiv.11872524.
AIM wavefunction file (.wfn): This format was first introduced by Bader’s AIMPAC program,
and currently supported by a lot of mainstream quantum chemistry softwares, such as Gaussian,
ORCA, GAMESS-US/UK, Firefly, Q-Chem and NWChem. The information in .wfn file include
atomic coordinates, elements, orbital energies, occupation numbers, expansion coefficients of
Cartesian Gaussian type functions (GTF). Supported angular momentum of GTF is up to f. The wfn
file does not contain any virtual orbital. The generation method of .wfn file is documented at the

2 General information
beginning of Chapter 4.
Note: Although GTFs with angular moment of g and h are not formally supported by original .wfn format, if g
and h-type GTFs are recorded in following manner, then Multiwfn is able to recognize them: 21~35 in "TYPE
ASSIGNMENT" correspond to YZZZ, XYYY, XXYY, XYZZ, YZZZ, XYYZ, XXXX, XXXY, XZZZ, XXYZ,
XXXZ, XXZZ, YYYY, YYYZ, ZZZZ, respectively. 36~56 correspond to ZZZZZ, YZZZZ, YYZZZ, YYYZZ,
YYYYZ, YYYYY, XZZZZ, XYZZZ, XYYZZ, XYYYZ, XYYYY, XXZZZ, XXYZZ, XXYYZ, XXYYY, XXXZZ,
XXXYZ, XXXYY, XXXXZ, XXXXY, XXXXX, respectively. The sequence shown here in fact is also the sequence
used in the .wfn outputted by Molden2AIM and Gaussian09 since B.01.

AIM extended wavefunction files (.wfx) : This is a format introduced as an extension of .wfn,
and it was supported by Gaussian 09 since B.01 revision. Relative to .wfn format, .wfx supports
higher data record precision and infinitely high GTF angular moment. The most special point of this
format is the newly added electron density function (EDF) field, that is using multiple GTFs to
represent inner core electron density of the wavefunction in which effective core potential (ECP) is
used. Due to this, the result of electron density analysis for the wavefunction using ECP is nearly
identical to that for full electron wavefunction. Currently the real space functions supported EDFs
in Multiwfn include: electron density, its gradient and Laplacian, local information entropy, reduced
density gradient as well as Sign(λ2(r)). Meanwhile topology analyses of electron density and its
Laplacian also take into account EDFs. Notice that EDF information has neither effect on ESP nor
the real space functions that relied on wavefunction (e.g. kinetic energy density, ELF). If you you
want to analyze these properties for heavy elements, you should use full-electrons basis sets, at lease
small-core ECP. Currently the only supported GTF type in EDF field is S-type (actually S-type is
enough for fitting inner density, since which is nearly spherical symmetry). Like .wfn, Multiwfn
does not allow virtual orbitals presented in .wfx file.
Multiwfn has a powerful built-in EDF library, taken from Molden2aim program developed by
Wenli Zou. As long as the input file contains GTF information (e.g. .fch, .wfn, .molden, .gms...),
Multiwfn always automatically loads EDF information from this library for the atoms using ECP.
Only when you use .wfx file as input and the .wfx itself already contains EDF field, the EDF
information will be loaded from the .wfx file rather than from EDF library. See Appendix 4 for more
details.
Note that although some programs other than Gaussian can also generate .wfx file (e.g. ORCA),
these .wfx files are unable to provide EDF field.
Notice: For certain version of Gaussian (e.g. G09 B.01), I found that the EDF field recorded in .wfx for rare
cases is problematic, namely the number of electrons represented by EDF field is unequal to the actual number of
core electrons exhibited by ECP. In order to verify if the EDF field is correct, you can use subfunction 4 in main
function 100 to obtain the integral of total electron density over the whole space, if the result is approximately equal
to the total number of electrons (core+valence electrons), that means the EDF field is correct.

Gaussian formatted checkpoint file (.fch/.fchk): Checkpoint file of Gaussian program (.chk)
can be converted to formatted checkpoint file (.fch/.fchk) via formchk utility in Gaussian package.
There is no any difference between .fch and .fchk. "fch" ("fchk") is the default extension generated
by Windows (Linux) version of formchk.
If you want to make Multiwfn able to directly load .chk file, you must set "formchkpath" in
settings.ini to actual path of formchk executable file in Gaussian package. In this case Multiwfn will
automatically invoke formchk to convert .chk file to .fch/fchk file, and if conversion is successful,
the .fch/fchk will be loaded and then be automatically deleted once loading is finished.
.fch/.fchk contains richer information than .wfn/.wfx files, virtual orbital wavefunctions are
also recorded, and meanwhile it provides basis function information for Multiwfn. If you want to

15

2 General information
use .fch/.fchk file as carrier for post-HF wavefunction, read the beginning of Chapter 4 carefully!
The .fchk file generated by Q-Chem and PSI4 can also be used as input file of Multiwfn. (If
the .fchk file was generated by relatively old version of Q-Chem, you must set “ifchprog” in
settings.ini to 2. You do not need to do this if your Q-Chem version is equal or newer than 5.0).
Molden input file (.molden or .molden.input or molden.inp): Currently, a wide variety of
quantum chemistry packages, such as Molpro, Molcas, ORCA, Q-Chem, CFour, Turbomole, PSI4,
MRCC and NWChem, as well as a first-principles code CP2K, are able to produce input file of
Molden visualization program. This type of file records atomic coordinates, basis set definition,
information of all occupied and virtual orbitals (including expansion coefficient of basis functions,
occupation number, spin, energy and symmetry), meanwhile there is no information only specific
for Molden. So in fact, Molden input file can be regarded as a standard and general file format for
exchanging wavefunction information. For Multiwfn, this type of file can provide atomic coordinate,
basis function information and GTF information.
Beware that the Molden input files produced by a lot of program are quite non-standard!
Currently Multiwfn only formally supports the Molden input file generated by Molpro, ORCA, xtb,
Dalton, NWChem (only for spherical harmonic functions and meantime symmetry is disabled),
MRCC (only for spherical harmonic functions), deMon2k, BDF, CP2K (only for spherical harmonic
functions). If the Molden input file you used is generated by other programs, the analysis result may
or may not be correct, you should first use the methods described in Appendix 5 to check if the
wavefunction has been correctly loaded.
Hint: Multiwfn fully supports the Molden input file standardized by molden2aim utility (see Section 5.1 for
detail), which is able to properly recognize Molden input files generated by many other quantum chemistry codes,
such as CFOUR and Molcas.

.molden file only formally supports basis functions up to g angular moment. However,
subfunction 2 of main function 100 can generate .molden file containing h functions, and Multiwfn
can then normally load it. Multiwfn can also normally load .molden file generated by ORCA and
Dalton even if h functions are presented.
Although Molden input file also supports Slater type orbital (STO), Multiwfn can only utilize
the Molden input file recording Gaussian type basis functions.
One severe drawback of Molden format is that it does not explicitly record nuclear charges as
other formats such as wfn and fch, therefore the results relying on nuclear charges (e.g. electrostatic
potential and atomic charge) will be problematic when ECP is used. To address this issue, Multiwfn
loads atomic indices in the file (i.e. the third column in [Atoms] field) as nuclear charges, thus if
you manually change the atomic index to the number of atomic valence electrons (equivalent to
effective nuclear charge) that explicitly represented in the quantum chemistry calculation, then the
result will be correct. If you are confused about this point, please check this post:
http://sobereva.com/wfnbbs/viewtopic.php?pid=721. Alternatively, you can manually insert [Nval]
field at the beginning of this file to explicitly specify number of valence electrons for specific
elements; for example, the following lines asks Multiwfn to set number of valence electrons of Na
and Cl to 9 and 7, respectively, while that of other elements remain unchanged.
[Nval]
Na 9
Cl 7

It is noteworthy that if you are using ORCA >=6.0, you do not need to perform the aforementioned

16

2 General information
modification on the molden file, because the molden file exported by ORCA contains [Pseudo] field,
which provides correct nuclear charge for the atoms with ECP and Multiwfn automatically loads it
(in this case the title line of the molden file must contain orca word so that Multiwfn is able to
recognize that it was generated by ORCA).
Another evident disadvantage of using Molden input file as wavefunction carrier is that this
format is not as compact as .mwfn and .fch. Due to this reason, for the same wavefunction, loading
speed of .molden file is much slower than .mwfn and .fch. Therefore, if you need to frequently
analyze a .molden file, I suggest you use subfunction 2 of main function 100 to convert it to .mwfn
format.
The way of generating Molden input file by some quantum chemistry programs is described at
the beginning of Chapter 4. If you are an ORCA user and you do not want to manually convert
the .gbw file to Molden input file via the orca_2mkl utility in ORCA, you can set "orca_2mklpath"
in settings.ini to actual path of orca_2mkl executable file in ORCA folder, then Multiwfn will be
able to directly load .gbw file.

site:

GAMESS-US or Firefly output file (.gms): If you want to use GAMESS-US or Firefly
(originally known as PC-GAMESS) output file as input file, you can change its extension as .gms,
then Multiwfn will properly recognize it. Currently, I can only guarantee that output file of
HF/DFT/TDDFT calculation with default NPRINT option can be normally loaded by Multiwfn. If
the point group is not C1, Multiwfn will be unable to deal with the output file.
The role of .gms is similar as .molden and .fch file, i.e. all of them provide atomic coordinates,
GTF and basis function information.
Since I am not a experienced Firefly user, I cannot guarantee that the compatibility with Firefly output files is
as good as GAMESS-US output files. For the former I only tested DFT single point task and TDDFT task.

Plot files of NBO program (.31~.40): The main purpose of supporting these file types is for
visualizing PNAO/NAO/PNHO/NHO/PNBO/NBO/PNLMO/NLMO/MO (their orbital coefficients
are recorded in .32~.40 respectively), .31 recorded basis function information. After boot up
Multiwfn, you should input the path of .31 file first, and then input the path of one of .32~.40 files
(for simplicity, you can only input the suffix when the filenames are identical).
Notice that among all types of the orbitals generated by NBO program, only using NBO or
NLMO to calculate real space functions is meaningful!
Protein data bank format (.pdb), .xyz, MDL Molfile (.mol/sdf), .mol2: These are the most
widely used formats for recording atom coordinates. They do not carry any wavefunction
information, but for the functions which only require atom coordinates, using these kind of files as
input is adequate. An advantage of .mol and .mol2 with respect to .pdb and .xyz is that they contain
atomic connectivity table, which is need by a few functions of Multiwfn, e.g. Calculation of EEM
atomic charges. If .xyz file contains multiple frames, only the first frame will be loaded.
Notice that the .mol file supported by Multiwfn is V2000 version, both the maximum number
of atoms and bonds that can be recorded are 999. More description about .mol format can be found
in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_table_file. .sdf file is simply a wrapper of .mol file with
additional information.
In a standard .xyz file, the name of each atom is element name. However, the .xyz file exported by VMD based

17

2 General information
on trajectory of some molecular dynamics programs is atom name used in the simulation, in this case Multiwfn is
unable to always correctly recognize actual elements from the atom names, so there is special rule in Multiwfn to
circumvent this issue: If there is a .pdb file with identical name in the same folder as the inputted .xyz file, element
name in the .pdb file will be used instead (however, if for an atom the element name is missing in the .pdb file, the
Multiwfn will still guess element from atom name in the .xyz file).

.pqr file: This format is very similar to .pdb format, but with different content. Behind the
columns corresponding to atomic X/Y/Z coordinate, there are two columns recording atomic
charges and atomic radii, respectively (the number of decimals of the two columns is not important,
the fields must be delimited by white-space). This kind of file can provide atom information as well
as atomic charge information to Multiwfn. Below is an example .pqr file of water. The REMARK
field could exist to record comments, they will be skipped during loading the file.

Charge files (.chg): This type of plain text file can be generated by some functions of Multiwfn
(e.g. population analysis functions), it contains element names (less than or equal to two characters),
atom coordinates (first three columns, in Å) and charges (the fourth column), users can modify them
manually. This file is free-formatted, all fields must be delimited by white-space. This file can
provide atomic charge information, the main use of which is to visualize electrostatic potential and
analyze it on molecular surface based on atomic charges, the electrostatic interaction energy based
on atomic charges can also be evaluated by subfunction -2 of main function 7 using .chg as input
file. When .chg file is loaded, the sum of all atomic charges as well as electric dipole moment
calculated using the atomic charges will be shown on screen.

.gro file: GROMOS structure format. This kind of file is most frequently employed in
GROMACS molecular dynamics program. .gro file can only provide atomic information for
Multiwfn. Note that since this file records atom name rather than element, Multiwfn automatically
guesses the actual element based on atom names and residue names during loading. However,
sometime the guessed element may be incorrect, therefore it is recommended to examine the printed
molecular formula after loading the file.
.cif file: This is the standard format for recording crystal structure. Symmetry operations must
be explicitly given in this file, otherwise positions of equivalent atoms cannot be generated.
Gaussian-type cube file (.cub or .cube): This is the most popular volumetric data format, it
can be generated by vast computational chemistry softwares and can be recognized by the majority
of molecular graphics programs. Atom coordinates, a set of grid data of real space function or
multiple sets of grid data of molecular orbitals could be recorded in this file. After a cube file is

18

2 General information
loaded into Multiwfn, one can choose main function 0 to visualize isosurfaces, or use main function
13 to process the grid data.
.vti, .dx and DMol3 grid file (.grd)
.vti is "ParaView VTK Image Data" format, which can record scalar field and vector field. This
kind of file can be generated by e.g. GIMIC 2.0 and ParaView programs. Only .vti file containing
scalar data of ASCII type is supported. Briefly speaking, this file is very similar to .cub file, but no
atom information is presented.
.dx is volumetric data format that can be exported by e.g. Volmap plugin of VMD program.
.grd file is the volumetric data format mainly used by DMol3 program. No atom information
is recorded in .grd.
Gaussian input file (.gjf), ORCA input file and MOPAC input file (.mop): These files can
provide atom coordinate information as well as the number of  and  electrons information to
Multiwfn. Note that the atoms must be recorded as Cartesian coordinate. .gjf can also provide cell
information to Multiwfn via “Tv” field.
Gaussian and ORCA output files
Gaussian and ORCA output files may provide atom information for Multiwfn.
• Gaussian output file: When "iloadGaugeom" in settings.ini is set to 1 (default, load input
orientation) or 2 (load standard orientation), Multiwfn will load (final) geometry and number of
electrons from this file.
• ORCA output file: When "iloadORCAgeom" in settings.ini is set to 1 (default), Multiwfn
will load (final) geometry from this file.
CP2K input and restart file (.inp and .restart): These files can provide atom coordinate
information and cell information to Multiwfn. Note that the atoms must be recorded as Cartesian
coordinate in Å.
Quantum ESPRESSO input (.inp or .in): It can provide atom coordinate information and
cell information to Multiwfn. Only ibrav=0 is supported.
Turbomole coordination file: If the first line of a plain text file is &coord, then it will be
loaded as Turbomole coordination file. $coord field provides atomic information. If $periodic and
$lattice are available, they will also provide cell information.
VASP related files
The following files are related to VASP code. Multiwfn is able to load them, the file name must
contain corresponding string and there is no .in or .inp extension. For example, to load a file as
POSCAR, the file name could be such as POSCAR_Si8 and MOF.POSCAR.
• POSCAR: This is one of input files of VASP, records cell and atom information.
• CHGCAR or CHG: This file records electron density generated by VASP. For spin
polarization case, it also records spin density at the same time
• ELFCAR: This file records ELF generated by VASP. For spin polarization case, it records
