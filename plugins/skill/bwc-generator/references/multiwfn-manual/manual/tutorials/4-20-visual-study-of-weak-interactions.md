After entering main function 0, we can see below graph

By comparing the graph and content of LMOdip.txt, you can find LMO1 and LMO2, which
respectively correspond to core orbitals of N5 and C1, have negligible polarity (i.e. the “norm” are
basically zero), reflecting that the LMO centers are very close to the nuclear positions. The LMO9
corresponds to lone pair orbital of N5, its “norm” is as high as 1.35 a.u., showing that the LMO
center deviates from N5 nucleus significantly. LMOs 3 and 5 correspond to the N-H bonds, LMOs
4, 7 and 8 correspond to the C-H bonds, it is well known that polarity of C-H should be lower than
N-H, this point is well reflected by the difference in their “Norm” values. The “Norm” of LMO6,
which corresponds to the C-N bond, is 0.3089, well indicating the fact that C-N is a polar bond.
In addition, in current system the Y coordinates of N5 and C1 are -1.438 and 1.330 Bohr,
respectively. The Y component of the bond dipole moment of LMO6 is 0.253, which is an evident
positive value. This observation shows that the negative and positive charge centers are on the N5
and C1 sites, respectively, corresponding to the fact that nitrogen has larger electronegativity than
carbon.

4.20 Visual study of weak interactions
4.20.1 Studying weak interaction in 2-pyridoxine 2-aminopyridine by
NCI method
Please carefully read Section 3.23.1 first to understand theory and how to use Multiwfn to carry
out NCI analysis. Besides, book chapter DOI: 10.1016/B978-0-12-821978-2.00076-3 and Angew.
Chem. Int. Ed., 137, e202504895 (2025) DOI: 10.1002/anie.202504895 provided very detailed
introductions of NCI.
Weak interaction character in 2-pyridoxine 2-aminopyridine system has already been studied
using AIM theory in Section 4.2.1, in this section we also perform NCI analysis for it, and meantime

4 Tutorials and Examples
I will show how to plot color-filled RDG map and AIM topology graph as a single map.
Boot up Multiwfn and input
examples\2-pyridoxine_2-aminopyridine.wfn
20 // Visual study of weak interaction
1 // NCI analysis
2 // Medium quality grid
After a while, calculation of grid data is finished. You can then select -1 to visualize scatter
map, from which interactions in the system can be examined preliminarily.

Since there are spikes (points nearly approaching bottom) at very negative region of sign(2),
according to the description of NCI method given in Section 3.23.1, we immediately know that this
dimer system must contain evident attractive intermolecular interaction. There is also a spike at very
positive side, therefore steric effect should exist in present system.
Then select option 3 to export func1.cub and func2.cub, and use VMD to plot color-filled RDG
map using the method described in Section 3.23.1, we obtain below graph

The type of interactions in this system now is very clear. Steric effect exists within the aromatic ring
because the color of corresponding isosurfaces is red. The two hydrogen bonds NH-N and NHO should be strong, since corresponding RDG isosurfaces have blue color. Between two

839

4 Tutorials and Examples
hydrogens there is also a RDG isosurface, since its color is green, it should be regarded as van der
Waals interaction, which is very weak. This region corresponds to the spikes in the middle of the
scatter map.
Showing AIM information in colored RDG map
Below I illustrate how to plot AIM critical points (CPs) and bond paths on the color-filled RDG
map, the resulting graph will be more informative, since the trace of interactions can be vividly
shown, while this kind of information is not explicitly revealed by NCI analysis.
Return to main menu and input below commands to search CPs, generate paths and then export
them as CPs.pdb and paths.pdb in current folder, respectively.
2 // Topology analysis
2 // Search nuclear CPs
3 // Search bond CPs
8 // Generate bond path
-4 // Modify or export CPs
6 // Export CPs as CPs.pdb in current folder
0 // Return
-5 // Modify or print detail or export paths
6 // Export paths as paths.pdb in current folder
Then we close Multiwfn. Drag CPs.pdb and paths.pdb into VMD main window in turn to load
them, select "Graphics"-"Representation", change "Selected molecules" to the second term
(corresponding to CPs.pdb), change "Drawing Method" to "VDW" and set "Sphere Scale" from the
default 1.0 to the minimal value 0.1. Note that in the CPs.pdb file, C, N, O, F atoms correspond to
(3,-3), (3,-1), (3,+1), (3,+3), respectively. Here we only want to draw bond CPs (i.e. (3,-1) type of
CPs) on the graph with yellow color, therefore we input "nitrogen" in "Selected Atoms" text box
and press ENTER button, then change "Coloring Method" to "Color ID" and select "4 yellow" in
the drop-down box. Currently, the graph looks like below

Probably you feel that the spheres corresponding to CPs are too large, however we cannot
further decrease the "Sphere Scale" using graphical window due to limitation of VMD. To make the
spheres smaller, you have to use corresponding command in VMD console window. To find proper
command to do this, we select "File"-"Log Tcl Commands to Console", then change "Sphere Scale"
to other value (e.g. 0.2), you will immediately see corresponding text-line command in the VMD
console window, for present the command is mol modstyle 0 1 VDW 0.200000 12.000000, where
the argument 0.2 corresponds to size of the spheres. Therefore, to decrease the sphere size to e.g.
0.09, we should input mol modstyle 0 1 VDW 0.09 12.000000 in the console window, then in the

840

--- page break ---

4 Tutorials and Examples
VMD graphical window you will see the spheres have already become smaller.
Next, we change the appearance of paths. In the "Graphics"-"Representation" panel, select the
third term in "Selected molecules" (corresponding to paths.pdb), change the drawing method to
"VDW", set coloring method as "Color ID" and select "3 orange", then use abovementioned skill to
set the sphere scale to 0.02. The final graph is shown below.

From this graph, not only the weak interaction regions are clearly revealed, but also the interaction
paths are vividly exhibited. Notice that there is no CP and path corresponding to the hydrogenhydrogen interaction, because in this region there is no position having vanishing electron density
gradient, and this is why in the scatter map the spike corresponding this H-H interaction does not
completely approach the bottom of the map. This observation reflects an advantage of NCI analysis
over AIM analysis, namely interaction can be revealed even if there is no corresponding bond CP.
The steps of showing the CPs and bond paths in VMD is somewhat lengthy, therefore I strongly
recommend to use VMD plotting scripts to automatically do all of above steps, please follow part 4
of this video tutorial: https://youtu.be/e4FpVc9ao48, you will find the process is extremely easy.
More information about this script can be found in Section 4.2.5.

4.20.2 Studying weak interaction in DNA by NCI method based on
promolecular density
Please read Sections 3.23.1 and 3.23.2 if you are not familiar with NCI analysis and the concept
of promolecular approximation. In this example, we will carry out NCI analysis for a DNA fragment
consisting of 10 base pairs. Since this system is fairly large, promolecular approximation is used for
approximately rapid construction of the molecular electron density. This example is also illustrated
as part 3 of this video tutorial: https://youtu.be/e4FpVc9ao48.
Here we only study weak interaction character of a local DNA region, which is enclosed in the
transparent box:

4 Tutorials and Examples

Boot up Multiwfn and input:
examples\DNA.pdb
20 // Visual study of weak interaction
2 // NCI analysis based on promolecular density
7 // Use mode 7 for defining grid data
84,565 // Use midpoint of atom 84 and 565 as center of grid data. You can view molecule
structure in your favourite visualization tool to find two proper atoms used to define center
120,120,120 // Because the spatial scope of grid data is large, we need relatively large number
of grid points, otherwise the grid spacing will be too large, which results in bad quality of RDG
isosurfaces
9,9,9 // Set the extension distances in all directions to 9 Bohr
Hint: You can also use mode 10 to set up box interactively in a GUI window, the box size and position of box
center is more controllable

After the calculation of grid data is finished, choose option 3 to export sign(2) and RDG as
func1.cub and func2.cub respectively in current folder, and then copy them as well as
examples\RDGfill_pro.vmd to VMD installation folder. Boot up VMD and input source
RDGfill_pro.vmd in console window to draw color-filled RDG isosurface map, the resulting graph
after some adjustments is shown below. (For better visualization effect, open "graphics""Representation" and change the drawing method of DNA to Licorice, change bond radius to 0.2.
Then enter “Display”-“Display settings...” to set “Cue Mode” to "Linear" and set “Cue Start/End”
to 2.25 and 3.75, respectively, so that distant atoms can be substantially screened). Finally, you will
get the graph below

4 Tutorials and Examples

It is clear that there are - stacking interaction between neighbouring base pairs (big flat
isosurfaces), and there are two strong hydrogen bonds among each base-pairs. The region pointed
by red arrow seems to be hydrogen bond because it connects hydrogen and oxygen, however since
the filled-color is green, we can conclude that it can only be regarded as vdW interaction.
The default isovalue 0.3 in RDGfill_pro.vmd is suitable for present case, but may be not
suitable for exhibiting weak interaction region of other systems, in that situations you need to adjust
it manually. You can either edit the .vmd file, or choose “Graphics”-“Representation” in VMD, then
select the representation with style “Isosurface” and reset isovalue by inputting expected value in
text box.

4.20.3 Visually studying weak interaction for water in bulk
environment by aNCI method
Note: Chinese version of this section is my blog article “Using Multiwfn to study weak interaction in molecular
dynamics” (http://sobereva.com/186), which also contains extended discussion.

If you are unfamiliar with NCI and aNCI methods, please first read the introduction given in
Sections 3.23.1, 3.23.2, 3.23.3, and book chapter DOI: 10.1016/B978-0-12-821978-2.00076-3, as
well as Angew. Chem. Int. Ed., 137, e202504895 (2025) DOI: 10.1002/anie.202504895. The aNCI
method illustrated in this section is a generalization of NCI analysis method for dynamic
environment, e.g. molecular dynamics (MD) process.
In this example I will show how to use Multiwfn to visually study the weak interaction between
water molecules in the MD simulation of bulk water system. You can use any program to perform

843

4 Tutorials and Examples
the MD simulation, as long as you know how to convert the resulting trajectory from private format
to the general .xyz format, which can be recognized by Multiwfn and utilized in aNCI analysis.
Here I assume that you are a GROMACS 4.5 user. The detailed steps of the MD process are
given below (very different to GROMACS >= 5.0), all of the related files can be found in
examples\aNCI folder. If you do not want to perform the MD simulation yourself, you can directly
download the wat.xyz, which will be utilized in aNCI analysis later:
http://sobereva.com/multiwfn/extrafiles/aNCI_wat_xyz.zip.
Generating MD trajectory by GROMACS
First, build a file named emptybox.gro, which records a blank box, and the side length in each
direction is 2.5nm. Then run below command to fill the box with waters.
genbox -cp emptybox.gro -cs spc216.gro -o water.gro
Run below command and select "GROMOS96 53a6 force field" to obtain the top file of the
bulk water system. SPC/E water model is employed.
pdb2gmx -f water.gro -o water.gro -p water.top -water spce
Then carry out NPT MD by 100ps to equilibrate the bulk water at 298.15 K, 1 atm environment.
grompp -f pr.mdp -c water.gro -p water.top -o water-pr.tpr
mdrun -v -deffnm water-pr
Using VMD program to load water-pr.gro, select a water close to the center of the box. We
select the water with resid index of 101, which is highlighted in below graph. Note that the two
hydrogens in this water have index of 302 and 303, and the index of the oxygen is 301.

This water will be freezed in the following MD simulation. In order to do so, we generate index
file, namely inputting below commands
make_ndx -f water-pr.gro
ri 101
q
Run following command to do 1 ns equilibrium MD simulation at 298.15 K, the trajectory will
be saved every 1ps, and finally we will obtain 1000 frames. The water with resid index of 101 is

844

4 Tutorials and Examples
freezed via the keyword "freezegrps = r_101". Note that NVT ensemble instead of NPT is used,
because NPT process will scale the coordinate of the atoms, which somewhat destorys the effect of
freezing.
grompp -f md.mdp -c water-pr.gro -p water.top -o water-md.tpr -n index.ndx
mdrun -v -deffnm water-md
Load the water-pr.gro into VMD, then load water-md.xtc to the same ID, select "File"-"Save
Coordinate..." option and set the file type as xyz, then input all in the "Selected atoms" box, input 1
and 1000 in the "First" and "Last" window, respectively. Finally, click "Save" button to convert the
GROMACS trajectory to wat.xyz.
IMPORTANT NOTICE: The wat.xyz currently records atom names rather than element
names. For example, if you open this file via text editor, you will find each water contains OW,
HW1 and HW2, which are atom names. However, in standard .xyz file, only atom elements should
be recorded. Therefore, in general cases, you should manually replace all atom names in the .xyz
file generated by VMD with element names. Fortunately, this step can be skipped in present example
because there is no element in the periodic table named OW, HW1 and HW2, therefore, only the
first letter of atom names will be employed by Multiwfn to try to identify their elements, and they
can be properly recognized as oxygen and hydrogens, since after loading the .xyz file, you can find
prompt “Formula: H1022 O511” on the screen, which is what we expected. If you find there are
undesired elements in the the “formula”, that means you have to replace the corresponding atom
names in the .xyz file as their actual element names.
Generating grid data by Multiwfn
Boot up Multiwfn and input following commands
wat.xyz
20 // Visual study of weak interaction
3 // aNCI analysis
1,1000 // The range of the frames to be analyzed
7
301,301 // Using atom 301 (the oxygen of the frozen water) as the box center of the grid data
80,80,80 // The number of grid points in each side
4.5,4.5,4.5 // Extend 4.5 Bohr in each side
Now Multiwfn starts to calculate electron density, its gradient and Hessian of each frame, then
their average quantities will be obtained, and finally Multiwfn calculates average RDG and average
sign(2). The whole process is time-consuming; at a common Intel 4-cores computer about half an
hour will be consumed. (Note that the electron density I referred here is produced by promolecular
approximation, which is constructed by simply superposing the density of the atoms in their freestates)
After the calculation is finished, you can select option 1 to check the scatter plot between
average RDG (X-axis) and average sign(2) (Y-axis), see below, there is also option used to export
the corresponding data points to plain text file.

845

--- page break ---

4 Tutorials and Examples

Select option 6 to export the grid data of average RDG and average sign(2) as avgRDG.cub
and avgsl2r.cub in current folder, respectively.
Since we wish to check the stability of weak interaction, we also select 7 to export thermal
fluctuation index to thermflu.cub in current folder. Note that this process requires recomputing
electron density of each frame, and thus is time-consuming.
Analysis
Copy avgRDG.cub, avgsl2r.cub, thermflu.cub as well as avgRDG.vmd and avgRDG_TFI.vmd
in "examples\aNCI" folder to the directory of VMD program.
Simply boot up VMD and input source avgRDG.vmd in its console window, the average RDG
isosurface will be shown with isovalue of 0.25, meantime the average sign(2) is mapped on the
isosurface by various colors. In order to make the graph clearer, one should screen unrelated atoms,
that is enter "Graphics" - "Representation"， then select the entry whose "style" is "CPK", and input
serial 301 302 303 in the "Selected Atoms" box and then press ENTER button. Now only the water
with resid index of 101 presents in the graph. After proper rotation and translation of view, you will
see

Unfortunately, around the water of interest, there are large amount of noisy isosurfaces, which
somewhat messed up the graph, thus it is better to shield them. This aim can be achieved by main
function 13 of Multiwfn, the steps are described below.
Then boot up Multiwfn and input
avgRDG.cub
13 // Process grid data
13 // Set the value of the grid points far away from specific atoms
1.5 // If the distance between a grid point and any selected atoms is longer than 1.5 times of
vdW radius of corresponding atom, then the value of the grid point will be set as given value
100 // An arbitrarily large value (should be larger than the isovalue of the RDG isosurfaces)
2 // Inputting selected atoms by hand
301-303 // The index of the atoms are 301, 302 and 303
0 // Export the updated grid data to a new cube file
avgRDG.cub // The name of the new cube file
Copy the newly generated avgRDG.cub to the folder of VMD program to overwrite the old
one, then use the script avgRDG.vmd again to plot the graph, after some adjustments you will see
(for clarity, the view of two sides is shown at the same time)

The graph we obtained this time is very clear. The color scale is from -0.25 to 0.25,
corresponding to the color variation of Blue-Green-Red. More blue denotes electrostatic interaction
or H-bond effect in corresponding region is stronger, and more red suggests more intensive steric
effect. Green region implies low electron density, corresponding to vdW interaction. From the graph
one can see that there are two blue ellipses near the two hydrogens, rendering that in the MD process,
strong H-bonds are formed due to the O-H group. The slender green isosurface exhibits in which
direction this water prefers to interact with other waters by vdW interaction. There is a big lump of
isosurface above the oxygen, on which the red color appears in the middle part, while blue color
occurs at the two ends; the latter reflects that the two lone pairs of the oxygen act as H-bond
acceptors during the simulation, while the former reveals the repulsive interaction zone between
waters.
Next, we study the stability of the weak interactions. First disable present isosurfaces, and then
input the command source avgRDG_TFI.vmd in the console window, after some adjustments you

847

will see

The color scale is 0~1.5, still corresponding to the color transition of Blue-Green-Red. More
blue (red) means the thermal fluctuation index (TFI) is smaller (larger), and hence the weak
interaction in corresponding region is more stable (unstable). The graph shows that it is stable that
the water behaves as H-bond donor, while the stability of the water acting as H-bond acceptor is
slightly weaker; the vdW interaction region is totally red, rendering that vdW interaction is evidently
unstable compared to hydrogen bond.
Finally, it is worth to mention that using aNCI method you can plot very nice picture to vividly
reveal interaction between ligand and protein, as illustrated in the following map. The detailed steps
of plotting this map have been described in this post: "Using Multiwfn to perform aNCI analysis to
graphically study protein-ligand interactions in dynamic process" (http://sobereva.com/591, in
Chinese). If you cannot fully understand this article via Google translator, please contact me, I will

4.20.4 Revealing both chemical bonding and weak interaction regions
in phenol dimer by IRI analysis
IRI (Interaction Region Indicator) was proposed by me in Chemistry−Methods, 1, 231 (2021).
Before following this section please read the original paper, Section 3.23.8 of this manual and DOI:
10.1016/B978-0-12-821978-2.00076-3 to gain basic knowledge about IRI first. Here I take two
examples to respectively show how to draw sign(2) mapped IRI isosurfaces and IRI plane map to
simultaneously reveal both chemical bond and weak interaction regions.
In addition, Multiwfn can also perform topology analysis on IRI to study it quantitatively, see
Section 4.2.11 for detail.
For more information of IRI analysis, please download the document "Tutorial of using
Multiwfn to perform IRI analysis" and follow it: http://sobereva.com/multiwfn/res/IRI_tutorial.zip.
In this document the procedure of performing IRI- analysis is also detailedly described. IRI- is a
variant of IRI aiming for vividly revealing  interactions.
It is highly suggested to read my this blog article: "Using IRI method to graphically study chemical bonds and
weak interactions in chemical systems" (http://sobereva.com/598, in Chinese), in which the feature of IRI is carefully
described, richer discussions are given, and more examples are provided.

Plotting sign(2) mapped IRI isosurface
Phenol dimer is taken as instance here. You will find almost all steps are identical to the NCI
analysis described in Section 3.23.1.
Boot up Multiwfn and input
examples\PhenolDimer.wfn
20 // Visual study of weak interaction
4 // IRI analysis
3 // High quality grid
3 // Export cube file
Move func1.cub, func2.cub and plotting script examples\IRIfill.vmd to VMD folder. Then boot
up VMD and input source IRIfill.vmd in VMD console window to execute the script, you will
immediately see below graph (the sphere scale of the atoms has been reduced to 0.6 in "Graphics"
- "Representation").

The IRIfill.vmd script employs the following color scale. The meaning of various colors is also
explained in the following map.

The graphical effect of the IRI map is obviously quite satisfactory. The weak interaction regions
are exhibited as nicely as NCI analysis, and the chemical bond regions are also clearly revealed by
blue isosurfaces, indicating that electron density in these regions is very large and implying bonding
effect is strong.
Note that the most suited isovalue of IRI function may be different for different systems, the
default isovalue in the IRIfill.vmd script is 1.0. You can modify it in the .vmd script file (namely the
value behind "mol representation Isosurface" in this script), or manually adjust it in "Graphics" "Representations" panel of VMD.
Plotting scatter map between IRI and sign(2)
After calculating grid data of IRI, you can select option “2 Output scatter points to output.txt
in current folder”, the generated output.txt contains X, Y, Z, IRI and sign(2) of every grid point.
By this file and gnuplot plotting script examples\scripts\IRIscatter.gnu, you can plot colored scatter
map between IRI and sign(2). Gnuplot is freely available at http://www.gnuplot.info. Move the
output.txt and IRIscatter.gnu to the folder containing gnuplot executable file, then in this folder run
command: gnuplot IRIscatter.gnu, after that you will find IRIscatter.ps in current folder. You can
open it by Acrobat or Photoshop or IrfanView (with ghostscript installed), or convert it first to other
image format using online image converter https://cloudconvert.com/image-converter and then
open, you will see

By comparing color between the IRI isosurface map shown earlier and the scatter map, you can find
correspondence between the spikes in the scatter map and isosurfaces. Clearly, the blue/cyan spikes
between -0.02 and -0.03 a.u. correspond to the H-bond interaction, while the green spike at
approximately 0.005 a.u. corresponds to vdW interaction, and the red spike at about 0.025 a.u.

corresponds to the steric effect within the benzene rings.
The default range of X-axis of the plotting script is -0.05 to 0.05. If you properly extend it, then
the spikes corresponding to chemical bonds can also be exhibited, you simply need to change lines
14 and 15 in the IRIscatter.gnu to
set xrange [-0.5:0.3]
set xtic

-0.5,0.1,0.3 nomirror rotate font "Helvetica"

After rerunning the plotting script, you will obtain the following map, evidently the spikes
between -0.4 and -0.3 a.u. correspond to chemical bonds, because electron density can reach this
magnitude only in chemical bonding regions.

Plotting IRI map without covalent bond regions
If you only hope to visualize noncovalent interactions in IRI map, the easiest way is choosing
option “9 Screen out covalent bond regions (set IRI to 100 for regions with sign(lambda2)rho < 0.1 a.u.)” in the post-processing menu of IRI analysis. After that, if you export grid data and plot
IRI map via VMD, you will find covalent bond regions have been screened out, as seen from the
following map

Plotting plane map for IRI
Sometimes it is also useful to plot plane map for IRI to reveal interaction regions in a specific

chemical bond interaction and weak interaction occur. The regions with IRI >1.0 has either large
gradient of electron density or negligible electron density, they are not of chemical interest.

4.20.5 Simultaneously revealing covalent and noncovalent interactions
in phenol dimer by DORI analysis
Frankly speaking, DORI (Density Overlap Regions Indicator) analysis is no longer valuable
since IRI analysis was proposed by me, because IRI has similar capacity of revealing all kinds of
interaction regions as DORI while the graphical effect is evidently better than DORI. However I
still use phenol dimer system to illustrate how to perform DORI analysis in Multiwfn. Please read
Section 3.23.4 first to understand basic knowledge about DORI.
Boot up Multiwfn and input
examples\PhenolDimer.wfn
20 // Visual study of weak interaction
4 // DORI analysis
3 // High quality grid
3 // Export cube file
Move func1.cub, func2.cub and plotting script examples\DORIfill.vmd to VMD folder. Then
boot up VMD and input source DORIfill.vmd in console window, you will immediately see below
graph.

The graphical effect of DORI map is obviously not as good as IRI map, especially the edge
region of the isosurfaces corresponding to weak interactions look quite ugly. Furthermore,
calculation cost of DORI is higher than IRI due to its much more complicated definition, therefore
IRI should always be used instead of DORI.
The DORIfill.vmd employs the same color transition method and color scale as IRIvill.vmd.
The most suited isovalue of DORI is different for different systems, the default isovalue in the
DORIfill.vmd script is 0.95, you can modify it if you find it is inappropriate.

4.20.6 Visualizing and analyzing van der Waals potential
Note: Chinese version of this topic is my blog article “On the calculation and analysis of van der Waals potential
as well as its plot in Multiwfn” (http://sobereva.com/551, in Chinese), which contains much more examples and
additional discussions.

The concept of van der Waals (vdW) potential proposed by me has been carefully introduced
in Section 3.23.7, please carefully read it first. In this section I will illustrate how to visualize and

analyze vdW potential.

4.20.6.1 Example 1: Helicene
In this example I will illustrate visualizing the vdW potential for helicene, whose structure is
shown below

To study vdW potential, you need to select a probe atom. For example, in this instance we want
to employ He atom as probe atom, therefore we change "ivdwprobe" parameter in settings.ini to 2.
Now boot up Multiwfn and input
examples\helicene.xyz
20 // Visual study of weak interaction
6 // Visualization of van der Waals potential
3 // High quality grid (the computational cost of vdW potential is extremely low, therefore we
use relatively good grid quality here)
As can be seen from the menu, now you can directly visualize vdW potential or its two
components, namely repulsion potential and dispersion potential. You can also export their grid data
to cube files. The unit used in this module is kcal/mol.
Now we choose option 3 to visualize isosurface map of the vdW potential, the resulting map
with isovalue of 0.6 (kcal/mol) is shown on the left side below. If you want to only visualize the
negative part, there is a trick: Set isovalue to -0.6 and unselect "Show both sign" check box, then
select "Isosurface style" - "Exchange positive and negative colors", the resulting map is shown on
the right side below ("Ratio of atomic size" has been changed to 4.0, the molecular representation
now corresponds to superposition of atomic vdW spheres).

In the above maps, the blue isosurfaces represent the regions where vdW potential is negative,
in these regions the dispersion attractive effect surpasses repulsion effect. It is expected that He
atom (or more generally, various small nonpolar molecules) tends to be attracted to the blue regions
due to dispersion interaction. All regions close to the nuclei are enclosed by green isosurface,
indicating that repulsive potential dominates the vdW potential in these places, this is the normal
case.
Can the vdW potential map be correlated with any practical observation? The answer is YES.
I carried out 2500 ps molecular dynamics simulation under 10 K for the complex consisted of a
helicene molecule and a He atom based on the GFN0-xTB theory in the Grimme's xtb code, the
trajectory frames (small spheres) and the isosurface of spatial distribution function (orange
isosurface) of the He atom are shown below

It can be seen that the majority of trajectory frames and the main distribution of spatial
distribution function are highly analogous to the blue regions in the vdW potential map showing
earlier, demonstrating that the vdW potential is indeed able to exhibit the favorable adsorption
regions if vdW interaction dominates the intermolecular interaction (of course, the precondition is
that both the adsorbate and the local region of adsorption sites are nearly nonpolar, otherwise
electrostatic interaction will largely control the adsorption behavior, in this case you should examine
electrostatic potential rather than vdW potential).
By the way, there is another way of visualizing grid data of vdW potential, namely plotting vdW potential

surface (note that the  is estimated using promolecular approximation). However, since the graphical effect of this
kind of map is not quite good, I prefer to study vdW potential in terms of isosurface map.

4.20.6.2 Example 2: Cyclo[18]carbon
The cyclo[18]carbon system was very extensively studied in my works Carbon, 165, 468
(2020), Carbon, 165, 461 (2020) and http://sobereva.com/carbon_ring.html for more. In this
example I will illustrate how to plot plane map of vdW potential for this system. The structure
optimized at B97XD/def2-TZVP level is given as examples\C18.xyz. As you can see, this system
is exactly planar and fully lying in the XY plane with Z=0.
We will plot color-filled map of vdW potential on the molecular plane. To do so, we need to
change user-defined function to vdW potential, namely setting "iuserfunc" parameter in settings.ini
to 92. We still use He element as probe atom like the last example, therefore "ivdwprobe" in
settings.ini should be set to 2.

In this map, red and blue colors represent positive and negative vdW potential, respectively.
From the map it can be seen that the vdW potential around the center of the cyclo[18]carbon is fairly
negative and thus this place has strongest ability in adsorbing nonpolar molecules. In the peripheral
region of this system the vdW potential is modestly negative, implying that nonpolar molecule can
only weakly interact with this system in this area due to dispersion attraction.
Please plot isosurface map of vdW potential as well as plane map of vdW potential in YZ plane,
so that you can better understand the overall distribution of vdW potential around this unusual
system. Via main function 3, you can also plot vdW potential between two given points, therefore
you can easily study variation of vdW potential starting from the ring center in the direction
perpendicular to the ring.
It is worth to note that it is very easy to obtain value of vdW potential at a given point, for
example, the center of this system, whose position is exact (0,0,0). You simply need to enter main
function 1, input 0,0,0, then choose either Bohr or Å as unit, then below information can be found
from screen:
User-defined real space function: -0.6979258635E+00

that is the vdW potential (with He as probe atom) is -0.70 kcal/mol.
Basin analysis on vdW potential
If you want to obtain most negative value of vdW potential, you can make use of the powerful
basin analysis module, which is detailedly illustrated in Section 4.17. Now we use this module to
find the most negative value of vdW potential for the cyclo[18]carbon.
IMPORTANT NOTE: Multiwfn also supports performing topology analysis on vdW potential to obtain its
minima, see Section 4.2.10 for example, the result is more accurate than using the basin analysis module. Therefore,
using topology analysis module is preferred over the way illustrated below!

2 // Medium quality grid
Wait for a while until the calculation is complete, then you can choose option 10 to visualize
the located minima of the vdW potential

Only the minima around the ring center are of chemical interest. As can be seen, these minima
are automatically clustered together and share the same index (1), they can be viewed as degenerate
minima. The minima at peripheric region of the ring can be ignored because they basically resulted
from numerical noise.
Then input
-3 // Show information of attractors
y // Show attractors after sorting according to their values
Then you can see position and value of each minimum before clustering. Finally, you can see
the positions and values of the final minima (i.e. after clustering):

Clearly, the minima of vdW potential (e.g. the points sharing attractor index of 1) in this system is
-0.757 kcal/mol. The printed coordinate "0.00000000 0.00000000 -0.01763924" corresponds to
average of all of its members.
If then you want to plot the minima via visualization softwares such as VMD, you can select
"-4 Export attractors as pdb/pqr/txt/gjf file", then select corresponding option to export
attractors.pdb in current folder, the meanings of atom index and residue index in this file are
explicitly shown on screen. Specifically, if you load this file into VMD, you can use "resid 1" as

4.20.10 Visualize and quantify weak interactions by Independent
Gradient Model (IGM)
Please read Section 3.23.5 and my reviews DOI: 10.1016/B978-0-12-821978-2.00076-3 and
Angew. Chem. Int. Ed., 137, e202504895 (2025) DOI: 10.1002/anie.202504895 to gain basic
knowledge about the Independent Gradient Model (IGM) method proposed in Phys. Chem. Chem.
Phys., 19, 17928 (2017). If you are not familiar with NCI analysis, you should also first read Section
3.23.1, since many aspects of IGM analysis are closely related to the NCI analysis. In this section I
will illustrate the use of IGM analysis in Multiwfn via several examples. More discussions and
instances can be found in my blog article "Investigating intermolecular weak interactions via
Independent Gradient Model (IGM)" (in Chinese, http://sobereva.com/407).
Because IGM method is independent of wavefunction, you can use any kind of input file
containing atomic coordinate information, such as .xyz, .mol and .pdb (see Section 2.5 for details).
The VMD program used throughout this section is version 1.9.3, it is freely available at
http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/.
NOTE: If your system is not extremely large and wavefunction file can be generated, I strongly suggest using
IGMH instead of IGM to gain more reasonable result. IGMH is an improved version of IGM, see Section 3.23.6 for
introduction and Section 4.20.11 of example. Even if IGMH cannot be used due to computational cost reason or
unavailability of wavefunction file, using mIGM instead of IGM is strongly suggested, see Section 3.23.10 for
introduction and Section 4.20.12 for example.

4.20.10.1 Example 1: Guanine-cytosine (GC) base pair
The IGM framework includes many useful ideas and defined many useful concepts, a series of
analyses will be conducted in this example. A simple system guanine-cytosine (GC) base pair is
taken as instance here. Some analyses may be ignored in practical studies, and sequence of analyses
is completely arbitrary.
(1) Studying g function
We first study the distribution character of g function by plotting it as color-filled plane map.

3,3,0.02 // Intervals for X, Y and color bar

8 // Enable showing bonds
14 // Brown
-1 // Plot again
You will see below graph

Above graph clearly reveals all interatomic interactions, and the magnitude of g is positively
relevant to interaction strength. As can be seen from the graph, all chemical bond regions have large
g value (the region with value higher than 0.2 is shown as white). The g function also outlines
three hydrogen bond regions among the base pair, where the g function has evidently smaller value
compared to the chemical bond regions.
The g can also be plotted as isosurface map. Return to main menu and input
5 // Calculate grid data
22 // g
2 // Medium quality grid
-1 // Show isosurface
The isosurface with isovalue of 0.15 and 0.03 are shown below (you can use higher quality of
grid or set the extension distance of grid data smaller to make the graph smoother)

860

4 Tutorials and Examples

Since chemical bond regions have relatively large value of g, only chemical bonding
interactions are visible when isovalue is set to 0.15. Clearly, g may be used as a function to exhibit
chemical bonds like ELF and IRI functions, with additional advantage that only geometry
information is needed. The weak interaction regions can also be simultaneously visualized when
isovalue is decreased to a small value, e.g. 0.02.
(2) Studying ginter function between base pair
The ginter is a key function in the IGM analysis framework, it is designed to reveal interaction
regions between two (or even more) fragments defined by users. Here we plot this functions to study
the interactions between the two bases. Although as shown earlier, these interactions can also be
revealed by simply drawing g, the isosurfaces corresponding to intrafragment interactions severely
polluted the graph. Fortunately, the IGM analysis allows us to separate the g as ginter and gintra,
which solely reflect the contribution to g due to interfragment and intrafragment interactions,
respectively.
Return to main menu and input following commands
20 // Visual study of weak interactions
10 // IGM analysis
2 // Define two fragments
1-13 // Range of atoms in the first base
14-29 // Range of atoms in the second base (you can also input c here to define the rest of the
present system as the second fragment)
2 // Medium quality grid
After calculation, you will see a post-processing menu. The meaning of each option has been
explained in Section 3.23.5. You can use option -1 to directly draw scatter map between g or ginter
or gintra versus sign(2). We choose option -1 and then select suboption 4, in the resulting map the
red and black points correspond to ginter and gintra, respectively.

861

4 Tutorials and Examples

If you are familiar with NCI method, you will naturally know how to discuss this graph, now
we try to identify character of peaks in the scatter graph. In the region where sign(2) is about 0.04, you can find that the ginter has a remarkable peak (with height about 0.06), which implies
presence of hydrogen bonds. If ginter isosurface is set to an isovalue lower than about 0.06, the
corresponding isosurfaces should be visible in the graph. In the region where sign(2) is
approximately +0.02, there is also a small peak of ginter. Since positive sign(2) implies repulsive
interaction, the peak may reflect weak steric regions in the center of the two rings between the two
bases. In above scatter map, there is a very prominent peak of gintra around sign(2) = -0.3. Since
this peak corresponds to intrafragment interaction, and corresponding sign(2) is not only negative
but large, rendering attractive and strong interaction, the peak must result from chemical bond.
Using Multiwfn you can directly visualize isosurface of ginter and gintra. To do this, we close
the scatter map, select option "4 Show isosurface of grid data", then choose corresponding options
and properly set isovalue, you will obtain below isosurface graphs

862

--- page break ---

4 Tutorials and Examples
As can be seen, ginter and gintra indeed solely exhibit inter- and intra-fragment interactions,
respectively. This greatly facilitates separate discussion of the two kinds of interactions.
From the above ginter = 0.02 isosurface map we are only able to visualize hydrogen bond
regions. To find steric region in the ring center between the two bases, we should further decrease
the isovalue of ginter to e.g. 0.008, as shown below. The ring-center steric regions are highlighted
by arrows.

(3) Drawing sign(2) mapped ginter isosurfaces
If sign(2) is mapped to ginter isosurfaces by different colors, then one can not only recognize
where weak interactions occur, but also immediately capture the character of the interactions.
Multiwfn itself is currently unable to plot color-filled isosurface map, we need to use VMD program
to do this, just like what we do in the NCI analysis.
Select option "3 Output cube files to current folder" in IGM post-processing menu, then
sign(2), g, ginter and gintra will be exported to sl2r.cub, dg.cub, dg_inter.cub and dg_intra.cub
in current folder, respectively. Move sl2r.cub and dg_inter.cub as well as VMD plotting script
examples\IGM_inter.vmd into VMD folder. Boot up VMD, input source IGM_inter.vmd in the
console window, you will immediately see below graph

The default isovalue employed by the IGM_inter.vmd script is 0.01, you can manually change
isovalue by dragging the isovalue bar in "Graphics" - "Representation" panel. In the script the
default color scale of sign(2) ranges from -0.05 to 0.05, and the default color transition is BlueGreen-Red. Therefore, the more blue the isosurface, the stronger the attractive interaction, while the
more red the isosurface, the larger the steric effect. Green zone in an isosurface implies that the
corresponding interaction is weak and may be regarded as van der Waals interaction.
Similarly, you can plot sign(2) mapped gintra isosurfaces. Just move sl2r.cub and
dg_intra.cub as well as the corresponding VMD plotting script examples\IGM_intra.vmd into VMD

folder, then input source IGM_intra.vmd in the console window to execute it.
(4) Decomposing interfragment interaction as atom and atomic pair contributions
The atomic pair g index (Gpair) is a quantitative indicator of contribution of an atomic pair to
total ginter between two fragments, while sum of all atomic pair g indices of a given atom yields
its atom g index (Gatom), which represents its importance for interfragment interaction. Percentage
atom g index, Gatom(%), corresponds to normalized Gatom multiplied by 100%, which can be
regarded as a rough measure of percentage contribution to interfragment interaction. In Multiwfn,
these indices can be easily evaluated. In the IGM post-processing menu, select option 6 and then "2
High quality" (this grid is absolutely fine enough), Multiwfn will calculate these indices. The result
will be exported to atmdg.txt in current folder, and then the program asks you if also exporting
atmdg.pdb in current, we choose y in present case.
Part of content of atmdg.txt is pasted here:

If you compare above data with the structure map of present system shown below, you will
find the indices are very meaningful and useful for discussing interfragment interactions

The largest three Gatom of fragment 1 are 6, 13 and 8, while that of fragment 2 are 25, 24 and
29, they are just the atoms closest to another fragment, undoubtedly they should have the most
important contributions to the interfragment interactions. H13-O24, N6-H25 and O8-H29 have the
largest Gpair, reflecting that they are the most crucial interactions for formation of the base pair.
Note that Multiwfn also exports IBSIW (intrinsic bond strength index for weak interactions)
to IBSIW.txt. Its definition has been described in Section 3.23.6. This index may have stronger

correlation with interatomic interaction strength than atomic pair g index.
(5) Coloring molecular structure by percentage atom g indices
Using VMD, it is also possible to map Gatom and Gatom(%) on molecular structure, so that
relative importance of various atoms for interfragment interaction can be vividly exhibited. If
needed, the ginter isosurfaces can also be shown together. Now we plot such a map.
First, plot color-filled ginter isosurfaces using the IGM_inter.vmd script as mentioned earlier.
After that, we need to remove the default representation showing molecular structure, so we enter
"Graphics" - "Representation", choose the first term (its current style is CPK), click "Delete Rep"
button. Then we drag the previously generated atmdg.pdb into VMD main window to load it. In this
file the “occupancy” field records Gatom(%), to graphically exhibit its value for every atom, we
should let VMD color the atoms according to their occupancy property. We enter "Graphics" "Representation" again, set "Drawing method" to CPK, and set "Coloring method" to “Occupancy”,
then click "Trajectory" tab, set upper limit of color scale to 50 and press ENTER button, now the
system in graphical window should look like below

Since the color transition set by IGM_inter.vmd is Blue-Green-Red, the largest percentage atom
g index in present case is 27% (as can be seen in atmdg.txt), while currently the range of color
scale for mapping Gatom(%) is set to 0~50, therefore in above map, the more green the atom, the
larger the Gatom(%). The green atoms may be viewed as "hot atom" for interfragment interactions.
Contribution to interfragment interactions due to the blue atoms can be ignored, since their Gatom(%)
are very close to zero.
This example ends here, through this example I think you have already recognized basic steps
of IGM analysis. In next several examples I will illustrate more.
Skill: Plotting sign(2) colored IGM scatter map
In Part (2) of this example, I have shown how to directly use Multiwfn to plot scatter map
between sign(2) and various forms of g. As illustrated below, by using gnuplot program, the
scatter map can be colored with the same sign(2) color scale as VMD, so that you can easier
identify the correspondence between the peaks of the scatter map and the colored ginter isosurface
map. Very similar way has been employed to draw sign(2) colored RDG scatter map, as illustrated
in " Special skill 1" of Section 3.23.1.

after that you will obtain IGMscatter.ps. If you open it by Acrobat or Photoshop or IrfanView (with
ghostscript installed), or convert it to other image formats first via online tool
https://cloudconvert.com/image-converter and then open it, you will see

In the current graph, the Y-axis corresponds to ginter. In the IGMscatter.gnu, the default color scale
is identical to the one adopted in IGMinter.vmd, namely -0.05~0.05.
If you want to use this script to plot gintra vs. sign(2), you should change "4:1:4" in the
IGMscatter.gnu to "4:2:4"; while if you want to plot g vs. sign(2), you should change it to"4:3:4".
If you find the range of X-axis is not appropriate, you can change the data behind "xtic" and
"xrange"; while if Y-axis is not appropriate, you can change "ytic" and "yrange".

more. If you think this graph is pretty and want to reproduce it, just follow below steps.
The pdb file of the dimer optimized at PM6-D3 level using Gaussian is provided as
examples\C60_coronene.pdb. Boot up Multiwfn and load it, then input below commands
20 // Visual study of weak interactions
10 // IGM analysis
2 // Define two fragments
1-60 // C60 is fragment 1
c // Other part, namely coronene, is fragment 2
2 // Medium quality grid
3 // Output cube files in current folder
6 // Evaluate atom and atomic pair g indices
2 // High quality
y // Export atmdg.pdb in current folder
Boot up VMD, enter below commands into VMD console window:
color scale method BWR
color Display Background white
axes location Off
display depthcue off
display rendermode GLSL
Then drag the atmdg.pdb into VMD main window, enter "Graphics" - "Representation", set
"Drawing Method" to "CPK", change bond radius from the default 0.3 to 0.8, set "Coloring Method"
to "Occupancy", set "Material" to "EdgyShiny". Then go to "Trajectory" tab, set lower and upper
limit of color scale to -15 and 15, respectively.
Next, we need to draw the ginter isosurface on the map. Drag dg_inter.cub into VMD main
window to load it, then enter "Graphics" - "Representation", change the default style from "lines"
to "Isosurface", set "Draw" to "Solid Surface", set "Show" to "Isosurface", then input 0.004 in the
"Isovalue" box and press ENTER button. Change "Coloring Method" to "ColorID" and select "7

green". Change the "Material" to "EdgyGlass".
Finally, we render the map. Select "File" - "Render", choose "Tachyon (internal, in-memory
rendering)" and click "Start Rendering" button, then you will obtain the graph shown at the
beginning of this section. The resulting graphical file is .tga format, you can use such as IrfanView
or Photoshop to visualize it.
Note that in present example, color-filled effect is only applied to molecular structure, but not applied to
isosurface. This is because in VMD, setting of color transition is shared by all representations, that means we cannot
use Blue-White-Red color transition for molecular structure but use conventionally employed Blue-Green-Red color
transition for isosurface. Considering that in present system there is only one kind of interaction, namely van der
Waals interaction, and in conventional color-filled IGM map this region is basically colored by green, I decide
directly assign green color for the whole isosurface, so that we are able to freely set color transition mode for coloring
molecular structure.

4.20.10.3 Example 3: Oxazolidinone trimer
The IGM module of Multiwfn is extremely flexible, it can be applied to any number of
fragments. In this example I use oxazolidinone trimer to show this point. The geometry was taken
from J. Chem. Theory Comput., 11, 3065 (2015).
We first use ginter to reveal all interactions between the three monomers. Boot up Multiwfn
and input
examples\oxazolidinone_trimer.xyz
20 // Visual study of weak interactions
10 // IGM analysis
3 // Define three fragments
1-11 // Fragment 1: Monomer 1
12-22 // Fragment 2: Monomer 2
23-33 // Fragment 3: Monomer 3
2 // Medium quality grid
3 // Output cube files in current folder
Then we use aforementioned method to plot color-filled ginter isosurface map via
IGM_inter.vmd script, you will see below graph

From color of isosurfaces in the graph it is found that the 1-2 and 1-3 interactions correspond to
typical hydrogen bonding, while 2-3 interaction is significantly weaker and thus more appropriate
to be assigned as van der Waals interaction.

Assume that we only want to study interactions between 1-2 and 2-3, and meantime wish to
screen the ginter isosurface corresponding to 1-3 interaction, how to do that? The answer is: Only
define two fragments, making fragment 1 correspond to monomer 2, while making fragment 2
correspond to monomers 1 and 3. Now we do this, input below commands
0 // Return to last menu
10 // IGM analysis
2 // Define two fragments
12-22 // Fragment 1: Monomer 2
1-11,23-33 // Fragment 2: Monomers 1 and 3
2 // Medium quality grid
3 // Output cube files in current folder
6 // Evaluate atom and atomic pair g indices
2 // High quality
y // Export atmdg.pdb in current folder
Then plot ginter isosurface again using the newly generated sl2r.cub and dg_inter.cub via
IGM_inter.vmd, and mean time color the structure according to Gatom(%) based on the atmdg.pdb
file, you will finally obtain below graph.

Now the isosurface corresponding to monomer 1-3 interaction is invisible. Since the color
transition set by IGM_inter.vmd is Blue-Green-Red, and I did not manually adjust the automatically
determined color range for mapping Gatom(%), therefore, in present graph, the site having largest
Gatom(%) is rendered as red, it should be regarded as "hottest atom" for the interactions under study.
The green or cyan atoms have modest magnitude of Gatom(%), while contribution of blue atoms to
the interaction is completely negligible.
Finally, let us only highlight interaction between monomer 1 and 2 while completely ignore
monomer 3. Input below command
0 // Return to last menu
10 // IGM analysis
2 // Define two fragments
1-11 // Fragment 1: Monomer 1
12-22 // Fragment 2: Monomers 2

869

2 // Medium quality grid
3 // Output cube files in current folder
Move the resulting dg_inter.cub and sl2r.cub to VMD folder and use the IGM_inter.vmd script
to draw corresponding color-filled isosurface map. It is better to make monomer 3 transparent, since
currently it is uninteresting. So we enter "Graphics" - "Representation", click the existing
representation with CPK style, input fragment 0 1 in the "Selected Atoms" box and press ENTER
button, now the monomer 3 is invisible. Next, click "Create Rep" button, input fragment 2 in the
"Selected Atoms" box and press ENTER button, then set the "Drawing method" as "Licorice" and
change the "Bond Radius" to 0.2, then set "Material" to "Ghost". Now you should see below graph,
in which only the interaction between monomer 1 and 2 is visible, while all interactions related to
monomer 3 are ignored.
PS: The concept of "fragment" in VMD is different to the "fragment" in IGM analysis of Multiwfn. In VMD,
when structure file is loaded into VMD, the bonding relationship is automatically determined, and then each unlinked
fragment is assigned to a unique fragment index. The index starts from 0.

As can be seen in this example, the partition of fragments is highly arbitrary. The union set of
all fragments is not necessarily equal to the whole system. When you intend to study intramolecular
interaction, a whole molecule can also be divided into multiple fragments to reveal interesting
interaction regions.
In this example only a simple system is taken as instance, however I think it is enough to
substantially exhibit the extreme flexibility and powerfulness of IGM analysis, Multiwfn and VMD
programs. The IGM method can also be easily applied to much more complicated systems; for
example, in my blog article http://sobereva.com/407 (in Chinese), I showed that IGM can clearly
reveal the interaction between two monomers in a tetramer consisted of four large flexible molecules.
Please play with the IGM analysis more!
It is worth to mention that g value at bond critical points (BCP) is positively correlated to
interaction strength (see Table 1 of IGM original paper), Multiwfn is also able to calculate it. First,
load a file containing wavefunction information into Multiwfn, then use main function 2 to carry
out topology analysis and locate BCPs, then using option 7 to examine properties of the BCPs, from
screen you can directly read g value. I do not explicitly present a corresponding analysis example
here, please try this kind of analysis yourself.

4.20.11 Using IGMH (IGM based on Hirshfeld partition of molecular
density) to study weak interactions
Please check original paper of IGMH (J. Comput. Chem., 43, 539 (2022)
https://doi.org/10.1002/jcc.26812), Section 3.23.6 of this manual, and DOI: 10.1016/B978-0-12821978-2.00076-3 to gain basic knowledge about IGMH method. If you can read Chinese, please
also check http://sobereva.com/621, which contains comprehensive and clear introduction of IGMH
as well as many relevant discussions.
In this section I will only present an extremely simple IGMH example. A very detailed tutorial
(40 pages) carefully introducing how to perform various kinds of IGMH analysis for both molecular
and periodic systems can be downloaded at http://sobereva.com/multiwfn/res/IGMH_tutorial.zip,
do not forget to check it!
The use of the IGMH analysis function is exactly identical to IGM, thus if you have carefully
read Section 4.20.10, you will be able to realize IGMH analysis smoothly. In this section, I use a
dimer consisting of 2-pyridoxine and 2-aminopyridine as an example, this system has also been
studied via AIM analysis in Section 4.2.1.
Boot up Multiwfn and input
examples\2-pyridoxine_2-aminopyridine.wfn
// Since IGMH relies on wavefunction
information, therefore you should use such as .wfn, .fch, .mwfn, .molden, etc. as input file
20 // Visual study of weak interaction
11 // IGMH analysis
2 // Define two fragments
1-12 // Atom indices in fragment 1
13-25 // Atom indices in fragment 2
2 // Medium quality grid
3 // Output cube files to current folder
Next, in order to plot sign(2) colored ginter isosurface map, we move the exported sl2r.cub
and dg_inter.cub from current folder to VMD folder, then copy the examples\IGM_inter.vmd script
to VMD folder, then boot up VMD and run source IGM_inter.vmd command in VMD console
window to execute the plotting script.

The color bar of this map is IGMH_colorbar.png in “examples” folder. Since the blue around
the center of the isosurface corresponding to the N-HN interaction is darker than that
corresponding to the N-HO interaction, it is expected that the H-bond interaction of N-HN is
stronger.
Hint: If you hope to make the radius of the isosurfaces in above map smaller, so that only the most important
interaction areas are shown, you can increase the isovalue from 0.01 to 0.015, namely entering "Graphics" "Representation", change the value in the "Isovalue" box to 0.015 and then press ENTER button. In this case, you
can also make the range of color scale narrower than default (-0.05~0.05) to make the color on the isosurfaces more
vivid, namely in the "Representation" interface click "Trajectory" tab, then input -0.045 and 0.045 respectively in
the two boxes and then press ENTER button.

You can also choose option 6 to calculate atomic pair g indices, the result calculated with high
quality grid is shown below

From this quantitative data, we can further confirm the conclusion that the N-H12N13 is stronger
than the N-H25O1.
For comparison purpose, you can plot the same map via IGM module, the sign(2) colored
ginter isosurface map is shown below (the sign(2) was calculated using actual density rather than
promolecular density). As can be seen, the graphical effect of IGM is much poor than IGMH, since
the isosurfaces are too bulgy and thus difficult to examine and compare, this problem cannot be
fully avoided even if you carefully adjust isovalue. Many comparisons between IGM and IGMH
can be found in the original paper of IGMH.

4.20.12 Using mIGM to study weak interactions
mIGM has been introduced in Section 3.23.10. Because its graphical effect is much better than
IGM while it has basically the same cost as IGM, using mIGM instead of IGM is always strongly
suggested. The use of mIGM is essentially the same as IGM, here a simple example is given.
examples\phenylalanineresiduestrimer.xyz is optimized trimer of capped phenylalanine, we use
mIGM to reveal the interactions within it. Boot up Multiwfn and load this file, then input

4 // Manually input grid spacing
0.2 // Grid spacing of 0.2 Bohr is sufficient to obtain a smooth enough image

Some .cub files have been generated in current folder. Move dg_inter.cub and sl2r.cub to VMD
folder while delete the other .cub file. Copy the examples\IGM_inter.vmd script to VMD folder, then
boot up VMD and run source IGM_inter.vmd command in VMD console window to execute the
plotting script, then mIGM graph will be immediately shown in the graphical window. After that, in
VMD choose “Graphics” - “Representation”, and input 0.07 in the “Isovalue” text box to change
isovalue, you will see the following image, which nicely reveals all kinds of interactions (dispersion
and H-bond) between the three molecules. The corresponding color scale is the same as the IGMH
mentioned in Section 4.20.11.

In the post-processing menu, you can also calculate atomic or atomic pair g indices via
corresponding option like IGM and IGMH analyses.

4.20.13 Using amIGM to reveal weak interactions in dynamic
environments
amIGM has been mentioned in Sections 3.23.11. The present section illustrates how to use
amIGM method to visually reveal the interactions between a phenol molecule and environment
waters in a simulation box. This is one application example in the original paper of amIGM method.
Initially, one needs to run molecular dynamics (MD) simulation to obtain a trajectory file, and

873

it must be in multiple-frame .xyz format. For example, you can load the trajectory generated by
GROMACS/AMBER/NAMD/CP2K... program into VMD software, and save to a .xyz file. It is
important to recognize that the region of interest should be fixed (preferably close to the center of
the simulation box) via freeze or position restraint setting. In this example, the only solvate molecule,
phenol, is fixed at the box center throughout the simulation, while the water molecules that fill the
rest of the box can move freely. The compressed .xyz trajectory file simulated at room temperature
for 1 ns can be directly downloaded at http://sobereva.com/multiwfn/extrafiles/phenol_in_water.7z.
After decompressing the package, you will obtain phenol_in_water.xyz, which contains 1001 frames
(the trajectory was saved every 1 ps).
Boot up Multiwfn and load the phenol_in_water.xyz, then input
20 // Visual study of weak interactions
-12 //amIGM analysis
2 //Define two fragments for amIGM. If you define n fragments, then amIGM will reveal all
interactions between the n fragments
1-13 //Atomic indices of fragment 1, corresponding to the phenol
c //The rest of atoms (waters) is defined as fragment 2
1,1000 //Analyze 1 to 1000 frames
11 //Because the interactions of phenol-water occur in various regions around phenol, the box
containing the grids to be calculated should cover the entire phenol, we choose mode 11 to realize
this aim, namely we will select a set of atoms, set extension distance around them and grid spacing
1-13 //The atoms for defining the box
3 A //Extension distance is set to 3 Å
0.2 //Grid spacing is set to the default 0.2 Bohr, which is adequate of obtaining fine enough
amIGM maps
Now Multiwfn starts to calculate. The cost is linearly proportional to the number of frames to
be considered, positively proportional to the number of atoms and number of grids to be calculated.
On Intel i9-13980HX mobile CPU, using 16 parallel threads, the calculation totally took up 8.8
minutes. The parallel efficiency of amIGM analysis is ideal, so using server CPUs with large number
of cores will greatly benefit.
Once calculation is finished, you can find many options in the post-processing menu, see
Sections 3.23.11. Here we choose option 3 to export the grid data of averaged ginter as
avgdg_inter.cub and averaged sign(2) as avgsl2r.cub in current folder. Move the two .cub files to
VMD folder, and copy the VMD script aIGM.vmd from “examples” folder to VMD folder. Next,
boot up VMD, run command source aIGM.vmd in the console window of VMD to execute the script,
then the two .cub files will be loaded, and amIGM map is immediately shown on screen, as shown
below

The current map is difficult to view clearly, so we need to change plotting settings. In VMD
main window, choose “Graphics” - “Representation”, input 0.003 in the “Isovalue” text box to set
isovalue of averaged ginter to 0.003 a.u. Then click the representation corresponding to CPK style,
input fragment 0 in “Selected Atoms” text box to only make the phenol visible. Now you should
see:

The color bar corresponding to this map is examples\IGMH_colorbar.png. Clearly, the above map
very vividly and successfully exhibited the average interactions between the phenol and surrounding
waters, demonstrating the great value of amIGM. If you further decrease the isovalue to e.g. 0.0018
a.u., additional isosurfaces will also be visible, which exhibit weaker interactions (mostly dispersion
effect), see original paper of amIGM for relevant discussion and many other examples.

Important notes
The system should not be too large, otherwise the cost of amIGM analysis may be prohibitively
high. The current system contains 1342 atoms, which is not quite large. If your system contains
huge number of atoms, you must use a smaller model instead, or truncate the present system
to only keep the atoms around the region of interest (to this aim, you can use a proper “selection”
when using VMD to save a new trajectory file).
The more the considered trajectory frames, the more realistic the result, and the smoother the
isosurfaces. Usually at least 500 frames should be taken into account.
As mentioned earlier, the position and structure of the key object should be fixed. As you can
see, in the MD simulation of the above instance, the phenol atoms were fully frozen at the
