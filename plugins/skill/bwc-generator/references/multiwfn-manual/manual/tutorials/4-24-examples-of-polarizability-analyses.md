Isosurface of sum of NOCV pairs 3 and 4 indicates that indeed there has been  interaction
between neighbouring acetylene, since green isosurfaces can be found in the  regions above and
below the new C-C bonds to be formed. However, since the energy is merely -1.85 kcal/mol, and
the isosurface is detectable only at extremely small density isovalue, the  interaction between
acetylene is completely negligible in practice. This argument can also be supported by calculation
of Mayer bond order of -electron for the wavefunction of TS structure, see Section 4.100.22 on
how to do. You will find the  Mayer bond order of C1-C5 is merely 0.010, whose magnitude is
small enough to be completely ignored.

4.24 Examples of (hyper)polarizability analyses
4.24.1 Parse output file of “polar” task of Gaussian to obtain
(hyper)polarizability and calculate related quantities
As introduced in Section 3.27.1, Multiwfn has ability to parse the abstract output information
of “polar” task of Gaussian and reorganize the data to a much more readable format, and meantime
many useful quantities are outputted together. In this section an example is given.
In "examples\polar" folder, NH3_polar_static.out and NH3_polar_dynamic.out are output files
of static and frequency-dependent (hyper)polarizability calculations for NH3 via a common
exchange-correlation functional PBE0. The corresponding Gaussian input files are also provided in
the same folder. In the calculation, a large basis set with abundant diffuse functions (aug-cc-pVTZ)
was used, notice that diffuse functions play a vital role in yielding reasonable (hyper)polarizability
and thus they are absolutely indispensable.
Studying static polarizability and first hyperpolarizability
First, we use Multiwfn to parse data from the NH3_polar_static.out. Boot up Multiwfn and
input

3

w=

0.071900 (

If we input 2, then the (hyper)polarizability data corresponding to 0.0656 a.u. incident light will be
loaded and parsed.
After outputting information about dipole moment and polarizability, Multiwfn asks you to
choose the type of hyperpolarizability to be outputted:
1: Beta(-w;w,0)

2: Beta(-2w;w,w)

Note: Option 2 is meaningless if "DCSHG" keyword was not used

You can select either one according to your requirement. Since as can be seen in
NH3_polar_dynamic.gjf, the keyword we used is polar=DCSHG, both the two types are available.
Now if you choose option 2 to parse (-2w;w,w), not only first hyperpolarizability will be
shown, but also quantities related to Hyper-Rayleigh scattering (HRS) will be printed, as shown
below (see Section 3.27.1 for detail)

Next, if you want to study evolution of scattering intensity with respect to polarization angle
of incident light, you should input y and then input an initial angle, for example, -180. After that
HRS_angle.txt will be generated in current folder, which contains scattering intensity corresponding
to polarization angle varying from -180 to 179 with stepsize of 1. If you use such as Origin to
plot the data as "Polar theta(X) r(Y)" map, you will obtain below map, in which the radial distance
of the red curve at different angles corresponds to calculated HRS intensity. The corresponding

Studying second hyperpolarizability
Gaussian is also capable of calculating static and dynamic second hyperpolarizability (). An
example input file is examples\polar\NH3_gamma.gjf, the output file is also given in the same folder.
In this task polar=gamma keyword was used, and two external frequencies are specified (532 nm
and 680 nm). Below I illustrate using Multiwfn to parse data of (-2w;w,w,0) at 532 nm.
Boot up Multiwfn and input
examples\polar\NH3_gamma.out
24 // (Hyper)polarizability analysis

7 // This option is specific for parsing polarizability and second hyperpolarizability

Dynamic polarizability and relevant quantities at 532 nm now have been shown on screen.
Then choose 2 to further parse gamma(-2w;w,w,0), then you will see

defined based on  are also shown, they are very useful in the study of . Note that above data are
given in input orientation.
Similarly, you can use Multiwfn to parse gamma(-w;w,0,0). If you want to parse
gamma(0;0,0,0), do not choose option -1 before parsing.

4.24.2 Studying polarizability and hyperpolarizability based on sumover-states (SOS) method
4.24.2.1 Calculate polarizability and hyperpolarizability for NH3
In this example I will show how to use Multiwfn to calculate polarizability and
hyperpolarizability based on sum-over-states (SOS) method for HF molecule. Please make sure that
you have read Section 3.27.2.1.
As introduced in Section 3.27.2.1, SOS calculation requires information of a large amount of
electronic states, including electric dipole moments, excitation energies, and transition dipole
moments between these states. Commonly this information can be obtained by ZINDO, CIS, TDHF
and TDDFT calculations. In this example we use the very popular CIS method. According to my
experiences, the more expensive methods TDHF and TDDFT, which can produce more accurate
excitation energies, do not necessarily give rise to better (hyper)polarizability than CIS when used
in combination with SOS technique.
Preparation
In this example we use Gaussian program to carry out the CIS calculation. However, Gaussian
itself cannot output enough information for SOS calculation. Though for CIS (and ZINDO) there is
a keyword alltransitiondensities, which makes Gaussian output transition density moment between
each pair of excited states, however electric dipole moment of all states still cannot be obtained in
a single run. Fortunately, we can use the very powerful electron excitation analysis module of
Multiwfn to generate all information needed by SOS based on the output file of CIS/TDHF/TDDFT
task of Gaussian or ORCA program.
First, run examples\NH3_SOS.gjf by Gaussian to produce output file NH3_SOS.out, and use
formchk utility to convert the checkpoint file to NH3_SOS.fch. If you do not have Gaussian in hand,
you can directly download them at http://sobereva.com/multiwfn/extrafiles/NH3_SOS.rar.
Since the SOS results converge often slow with respect to the number of excited states taken into account, we
produce as high as 150 excited states in this example to substantially avoid truncation error. Of course, employing
higher number of excited states needs more computational time in both of the CIS calculation and the subsequent
SOS calculation in Multiwfn. In most practical studies, 100 states are generally large enough, and even 70 is often
enough to provide usable results. Calculation of hyperpolarizability, especially the high-order ones, has very
stringent requirements on the quality of basis set, abundant diffuse functions are absolutely indispensable. In this
example we employ def2-TZVPPD (J. Chem. Phys., 133, 134105), which is a high-quality basis set optimized for
calculation of molecular response properties. Since this is not a built-in basis set in current version of Gaussian, it
was picked from BSE website (https://www.basissetexchange.org). The keyword IOp(9/40=5) is important, because
in the ZINDO/CIS/TDHF/TDDFT task by default Gaussian only outputs the transition coefficients whose absolute
values are larger than 0.1, while IOp(9/40=5) lowers the criterion to 0.00001, so that much more coefficients can be
outputted, and thereby we can obtain accurate transition dipole moments by Multiwfn at next step. It is noteworthy
that you can also use TDHF or TDDFT instead of CIS, for example you can write #P TD(nstates=150) CAMB3LYP/gen IOp(9/40=5).

14.552483

As can be seen, not only the polarizability tensor, but also some related quantities are outputted.
Their definitions can be found in Section 3.100.20. The isotropic average polarizability we obtained
here is 14.59, which is in perfect agreement with the experimentally determined value 14.56! (Mol.
Phys., 33, 1155)
Then we calculate dynamic polarizability (-;) and assume the frequency of external field
to be 0.0719 a.u. Select option 1 again, input 0.0719, from the output we can see the dynamic
isotropic polarizability at =0.0719 is 14.86, which is slightly larger than the static counterpart.
Calculation of first hyperpolarizability (beta)
Next, we calculate first hyperpolarizability and consider the static case (0;0,0). Select option
2 and input 0,0. Only the  component along the dipole moment direction, namely ||, is what we
are particularly interested in, since only this quantity can be determined experimentally. From the
output we find ||(0;0,0) is -38.98. The corresponding experimental value is not available, however
this value is close to the highly accurate value calculated by CCSD(T) method (-34.3, see J. Chem.
Phys., 98, 3022 (1993)).
Subsequently, we calculate (-2;,) at =0.0656 a.u. Select option 2 again and input 0.0656,
0.0656 to set the frequency of both two external fields as 0.0656 a.u. This time the || value is -49.69,
which is again in excellent agreement with the experimentally determined value -48.91.2 (see A.
Hernández-Laguna et al. (eds.), Quantum Systems in Chemistry and Physics, Vol. 1, p111)
Note: Although in this example the agreement between our SOS/CIS calculations and the reference values is
surprisingly good, this is not always hold for other systems. The SOS/CIS method sometimes severely overestimates
 value!

Calculation of second hyperpolarizability (gamma)
Finally, we calculate second hyperpolarizability . Select 3 and input 0,0,0 to assume static
electric fields. Since calculation of  is evidently more time-consuming than , Multiwfn does not

933

automatically use all states but allow you to set the number of states to be taken into account. Larger
value in principle gives rise to better result, but of course more time will be consumed in the
calculation. Here, we input 150 to use all states. After a while, result is shown on screen, the average
of  is 928.74. Beware that this value may be inaccurate (reference value is not available, so I am
not sure if this is a good result), one of the main reasons is that the basis set we used in the electron
excitation calculation is not large enough. Accurate calculation of  usually requests a basis set like
d-aug-cc-pVTZ (or an even better one), which has an additional shell of diffuse functions compared
to the commonly used aug-cc-pVTZ.
Multiwfn is also capable of calculating third hyperpolarizability (-;1,2,3,4) where
=1+2+3+4, but we do not do this in present example, because this quantity is fairly
unimportant, and the calculation is terribly expensive when the number of states in consideration is
large; moreover, a sky-high quality of basis set must be employed in the calculation...
Variation of (hyper)polarizability with respect to number of considered states
A very important point in SOS calculation is that the number of states used must be high enough;
in other words, if n states are involved in your SOS studies, the variation of the (hyper)polarizability
with respect to the number of states have to be converged before n, otherwise n must be enlarged.
By using Multiwfn we can readily examine if the convergence condition is satisfied. Here we check
the convergence of static . Select option 6 and input 0,0, after a while, the result will be exported
to beta_n.txt and beta_n_comp.txt in current folder, the meaning of each column is clearly indicated
on screen. Then you can use your favourite tool to plot the data in the beta_n.txt. If you are an Origin
user, you can directly drag this file into Origin window and plot the data as curve maps. Below
graphs show the variation of static || as well as static isotropic average polarizability <> with
respect to number of considered states.

It is clear that both of the two quantities have basically converged at n=100. Since we employed 150
states in our calculations, the error due to the truncation of states can be safely ignored. From the
graph one can also see that if the number of states is truncated at 70, the results are still qualitatively
correct.
You can also analogously use options 5 and 7 to study the convergence behavior of  and ,
respectively.
Variation of (hyper)polarizability with respect to frequency of external fields
In the SOS module of Multiwfn, one can also easily study the variation of dynamic
(hyper)polarizability with respect to the frequency of external fields. For example, we investigate
the variation of (-1;1,0) as 1 varies from 0 to 0.5 a.u. with stepsize of 0.01. Write a plain text
file, each row corresponds to a pair of 1, 2 (2 is fixed at zero in this example), for example

Tips: For convenience, you can utilize Microsoft Excel program to generate frequency list, and save the table
as .txt file (you can select such as "Text (tab delimited)", but do not choose "Unicode text").

Then choose option 16, input the path of the plain text file, the  will be calculated at each pair of
frequencies, the result will be outputted to beta_w.txt and beta_w_comp.txt in current folder, the
meaning of each column of the data is clearly indicated on screen. The data in these files can be
directly plotted as curve map by Origin, for example the magnitude of (-1;1,0) is shown below:

Frequency of external field 1

Similarly, you can also use options 15 and 17 to study the variation of  and  with respect to
frequency of external fields, respectively.
Scanning both 1 and 2 of (-(1+2);1,2)
By subfunction 19 of the SOS module, you can also scan both 1 and 2 of (-(1+2);1,2).
For example, we input below commands in the SOS module
19
-0.6,0.6,100 // Lower limit, upper limit and number of steps of 1 (in a.u.)
-0.6,0.6,100 // Lower limit, upper limit and number of steps of 2 (in a.u.)
After a while, beta_w.txt and beta_w_comp.txt are generated in current folder, the meaning of
each column of the files is clearly mentioned on screen. To visually study how total  varies with
respect to change in 1 and 2, you can plot relief map with first, second and 7th columns as X, Y
and Z data, respectively. The map shown below was plotted by Sigmaplot:

This kind map exhibits one photon resonance (-1;1,0) or (-2;0,2), sum frequency
generation and difference frequency generation character of present system. Occurrence of a large
peak at the position where one of 1 and 2 is zero implies significant Electro-optics Pockels effect
at the corresponding frequency, a large peak at a frequency 1=2 indicates strong second harmonic
generation (SHG) effect at that frequency, a large peak at frequency 1= -2 shows remarkable
optical rectification effect at that frequency. See ACS Appl. Nano Mater., 2, 1648 (2019) for example

hyperpolarizability of NH2-biphenyl-NO2
Note: Chinese version of this section is my blog article “Using Multiwfn to perform two-level and three-level
model analyses for first hyperpolarizability” (http://sobereva.com/512).

In literatures about computational study of hyperpolarizability, two-level model is frequently
adopted to shed light on the major factors that influence the first hyperpolarizability, this analysis
also provides clear insight into the difference in  between analogous systems. The three-level
model implemented in Multiwfn is a natural extension of the two-level model to include two excited
states into account. Please read Section 3.27.2.2 first to gain basic knowledge about the two- and
three-level models. In this section I will illustrate basic step of performing these analyses
It is important to emphasize that the two- or three-level analysis is useful only when these two
conditions are satisfied:
• Only one component of  (namely XXX or YYY or ZZZ) plays dominant role. This
component should be subjected to the analysis
• One excited state (for two-level model) or two excited states (for three-level model) has much
larger contribution to  than all other excited states
Most donor--acceptor type of systems well satisfy the above two conditions. In this section
we take a typical donor--acceptor system NH2-biphenyl-NO2 as example. The D-pi-A.fchk and Dpi-A.out in "examples\excit" folder were produced by Gaussian TDDFT task for this system at
CAM-B3LYP/6-31G(d) level, five lowest-lying singlet excited states were yielded. It is worth to

note that without sufficient diffuse functions, (hyper)polarizability cannot be estimated at
quantitative accuracy level; however, our present aim is simply using the two- and three-level
models to very roughly discuss the factors influencing the , so using these two files to conduct the
analysis is acceptable.
Prepare input file
Boot up Multiwfn and input below commands
examples\excit\D-pi-A.fchk
18 // Electron excitation analysis module
5 // Calculate transition dipole moments and dipole moment for all excited states
examples\excit\D-pi-A.out
3 // Generate SOS.txt, which contains all information needed by the two- or three-level analysis
Now we are ready to perform the two/three-level analysis. Before doing this, we need to
confirm which component of  should be studied. The molecular geometry of D-pi-A.fchk is shown
below (displayed by main function 0). As can be see, the direction of donor--acceptor path is fully
parallel to X-axis, hence it is expected that only XXX of current system is prominent.

Two-level analysis
Reboot Multiwfn and input
SOS.txt
24 // (Hyper)polarizability analysis
2 // Study (hyper)polarizability by sum-over-states (SOS) method
20 // Two- or three-level model analysis of 
Now Multiwfn prints key information for all excited states, which are very closely related to
two- and three-level analyses:

Because excited state 2 has much larger magnitude of transition dipole moment and variation
of dipole moment than others, and meantime the excitation energy of excited state 2 is low, thus this
state can be unambiguously identified as the so-called crucial state.
Next, we input 1-5 to perform two-level analysis for every excited state from 1 to 5, you will
see

All terms involved in the two-level model have been given above, see Section 3.27.2.2 for the
expression of the two-level model. If you have an analogous system, for example the two benzene
rings in current system are replaced with three benzene rings, you can use the above quantities to
study how various factors cause the difference in XXX according to the two-level model.
Three-level analysis
We can also carry out three-level model analysis. In the Multiwfn window, we input

It can be seen that all terms involved in the three-level model analysis have been given. We
also find that the individual contribution of excited state 1 to XXX is quite small, and the term due
to coupling between the two states is also negligible, implying that employing two-level model
analysis is completely adequate for the present system, including more states into the analysis does
not provide additional insight.
The reason why the individual contribution corresponding to the excited state 1 is fairly low is
quite easy to understand. According to the two-level model, contribution to a given  component is
positively proportional to variation of dipole moment and square of transition dipole moment in that
component. Compared to the excited state 2, both the two quantities of excited state 1 are
conspicuously smaller.
Hint: In some cases, the output file of electron excitation task may contain large number of states, while for
performing two- or three-level model analysis we always only need the first few low-lying excited states. In order
to significantly reduce the cost of generating the SOS.txt in this situation, you can properly set "maxloadexc"
parameter in settings.ini. For example, the output file contains as many as 100 excited states, however it is anticipated
that the state of interest should be no higher than the 5th excited state, hence you can set "maxloadexc" to 5, then
only the first 5 excited states will be recognized, loaded, and subjected to calculation.

4.24.3 Example of studying (hyper)polarizability density
Chinese version of this section is my blog article "Using Multiwfn to extremely conveniently plot
(hyper)polarizability density and the contribution of three-dimensional space to (hyper)polarizability"
(http://sobereva.com/683).

4 Tutorials and Examples
Please read Section 3.27.3 first to gain basic knowledge about (hyper)polarizability density
and spatial contribution to (hyper)polarizability analyses. Below we will study the second
hyperpolarizability density for a typical small molecule H2CO. Polarizability density and first
hyperpolarizability density can also be studied via almost exactly the same way, you just need to
choose corresponding quantity in the interface of Multiwfn.
The orientation of the molecule must be clarified when perform this kind of analysis, in current
case the C=O bond is parallel to the Z-axis, as shown below. In this example we focus on studying
(3)

ZZZ component of second hyperpolarizability density (𝜌𝑧𝑧𝑧 ) and spatial contribution to zzzz (ZZZZ
(3)
component of second hyperpolarizability), namely −𝑧𝜌𝑧𝑧𝑧 .

Before performing hyperpolarizability density analysis, it is suggested to carry out a regular
static  calculation using Gaussian, so that we can judge whether our hyperpolarizability density
analysis is reasonable enough. The Gaussian input and output files of the task have been provided
as gamma.gjf and gamma.out in "examples\polar\polardens" folder, the commonly used PBE0/augcc-pVTZ level is employed. As can be seen at the end of the output file, the ZZZZ is 0.309211D+04
a.u. (namely 3092.1 a.u.). The geometry used in this task was optimized at B3LYP/def-TZVP level.
Preparation work
Boot up Multiwfn and input
examples\polar\polardens\H2CO.xyz //Multiwfn will load the geometry from this file, which
contains the same coordinate as gamma.gjf
24 //(Hyper)polarizability analysis
3 //(Hyper)polarizability density analysis
3
//Study second hyperpolarizability density and spatial contribution to second
hyperpolarizability
3 //Z direction
1 //Generate Gaussian input files of single point task under different external electric fields
[Press ENTER button directly] //Use 0 and 1 as net charge and spin multiplicity, respectively
Now Multiwfn generates Z-2.gjf, Z-1.gjf, Z+1.gjf and Z+2.gjf in current folder. If you open
them via text editor, you will find they correspond to single point task at PBE0/aug-cc-pVTZ level
under different electric fields, and meantime .wfx file (a wavefunction format) with same name as
input file will be generated in current folder. The magnitude of finite electric field is 0.003 a.u.,
therefore, for example, Z+2.gjf corresponds to applying Z-direction external electric field of
0.003*2 = 0.006 a.u. magnitude. The “nosymm” keyword in the files are important, which prevents

940

4 Tutorials and Examples
Gaussian from automatically reorientating the molecule during calculation. You may manually
change keywords in the .gjf files if you want to use other computational level and settings.
Run the .gjf files via Gaussian (you may use the runall.sh shell script in “examples” folder to
invoke Gaussian to run all files in current folder). Then you will find Z-2.wfx, Z-1.wfx, Z+1.wfx and
Z+2.wfx in current folder.
Next, input following commands in Multiwfn
2 //Load .wfx files of single point task under different external electric fields
[Press ENTER button directly] //Assume that the .wfx files are in current folder
As prompted on screen, all needed .wfx files have been found by Multiwfn, and a new interface
appears, you can choose to calculate grid data or plot plane map. Evidently, the “second
hyperpolarizability density” and “spatial contribution to second hyperpolarizability” in the interface
(3)

(3)

in the present situation refer to 𝜌𝑧𝑧𝑧 and −𝑧𝜌𝑧𝑧𝑧 , respectively.
Visualization isosurface map
(3)

We first visualize isosurface map of 𝜌𝑧𝑧𝑧 . To do so, we input
1 //Generate grid data of second hyperpolarizability density
2 //Medium quality grid
1 //Visualize isosurface map
(3)

After setting isovalue to 0.5, you will see the isosurface map of 𝜌𝑧𝑧𝑧 :

However, from this map it is still somewhat difficult to discuss contribution of various spatial
(3)

regions to the ZZZZ, because the -z factor has not been taken into account. To obtain −𝑧𝜌𝑧𝑧𝑧 , we
close GUI window, and input below commands
0 //Return
2 //Generate grid data of spatial contribution to second hyperpolarizability
2 //Medium quality grid
From screen you can find the integral of the current grid data is 3008.2 a.u., which is close to
the γZZZZ value 3092.1 a.u. shown in examples\polar\polardens\gamma.out, indicating that the grid
(3)

data of −𝑧𝜌𝑧𝑧𝑧 is indeed reasonable (if you use higher quality grid and enlarge the default extension
distance when setting up grid, the integral will become closer to 3092.1 a.u.).
Now choose option 2 to visualize isosurface map. After setting isovalue to 2, you will see the

941

(3)

following isosurface map of −𝑧𝜌𝑧𝑧𝑧 :

In the figure, the regions enclosed by green (blue) isosurfaces have positive (negative)
contribution to γZZZZ. It can be seen that in the molecular valence region, the contribution is basically
negative, however at the two ends of the molecule the contribution is remarkably positive, and the
magnitude obviously exceeds the negative region, this is why the current system has an evidently
positive value of γZZZZ. Clearly via such a picture, you can immediately explain why a component
of γ is big or small, or why it is positive or negative. Undoubtedly this kind of analysis is extremely
useful in studying underlying characteristics of (hyper)polarizability!
Plotting plane map
(3)

Next, we plot plane map of 𝜌𝑧𝑧𝑧 , from which we can better understand detailed distribution of
this function in a specific plane. Input 0 to return to last menu, then input
3 //Plot plane map of second hyperpolarizability density
1 //Color-filled map
[Press ENTER button directly] //Use the default 200*200 grid points
3 //YZ plane
0 //X=0
Close the graph, then input following commands to fine-tune the graphical effect
19 //Set color transition
8 //Blue-White-Red
2 //Enable showing contour lines
3 //Change contour line setting
4 //Delete some contour lines (we only want to keep contour lines with relatively large value
in this example)
32-37
4 //Delete some contour lines
1-6
1 //Save setting and return
4 //Enable showing atom labels and reference point

You will see the following map, which looks pretty nice

After choosing “-5 Return to main menu”, then you can select “4 Plot plane map of spatial
(3)

contribution to second hyperpolarizability” to plot −𝑧𝜌𝑧𝑧𝑧 via similar way.
Obtaining atomic contribution to (hyper)polarizability
Thanks to the flexibility of Multiwfn, one can easily obtain atomic contribution to
(hyper)polarizability by integrating corresponding (hyper)polarizability density in each atomic
space based on its grid data. Commonly, employing fuzzy atomic space is recommended, because
the cost is very low. Here we will calculate atomic contributions to ZZZZ by integrating grid data of
-z(3)ZZZ.
(3)

After generating grid data of −𝑧𝜌𝑧𝑧𝑧 via the option “2 Generate grid data of spatial contribution
to second hyperpolarizability” mentioned earlier, we select option “2 Export grid data as cube file”
and then press ENTER button directly to export the grid data as grid.cub in current folder. Then set
"iuserfunc" in settings.ini to -1, so that the user-defined function will correspond to the interpolated
function based on the loaded grid data. Reboot Multiwfn, load grid.cub, then input below commands:
15 //Fuzzy atomic space analysis
1 //Integrate a real space function in every atomic space
100 //User-defined function
The result is

the ZZZZ value (3092.1 a.u.) outputted by Gaussian polar=gamma task, implying that the data is
meaningful.

4.24.5 Example of using unit sphere representation to visually study
(hyper)polarizability
Note: Chinese version of this section is my blog article “Using Multiwfn to graphically study
(hyper)polarizability tensor by unit sphere representation” (http://sobereva.com/547, in Chinese), which contains
more discussions.

Please read Section 3.27.5 if you are not familiar with unit sphere and vector representation
analysis of (hyper)polarizability. In this section, I will take CH3NHCHO and cyclo[18]carbon as
instances to show how to use Multiwfn in conjunction with VMD visualization software to realize
these kinds of analysis and to demonstrate the usefulness of these methods.

4.24.5.1 First-order hyperpolarizability of CH3NHCHO
In this section, we analyze SHG (second-harmonic generation) type of dynamic first
hyperpolarizability () at 1030 nm for CH3NHCHO, one of our purposes is to reproduce the Fig.
2(e) in the original paper of the unit sphere representation method (J. Comput. Chem., 32, 1128
(2011)). We will use the same calculation level as the authors, namely B3LYP/6-311+G** for
geometry optimization and HF/6-311++G** for hyperpolarizability calculation. The authors
employed GAMESS-US program, but we will employ Gaussian to calculate .
First, use Gaussian to run examples\polar\CH3NHCHO\polar.gjf, its content is shown below
#P HF/6-311++g(d,p) polar=DCSHG CPHF=rdfreq
[blank line]
B3LYP/6-311++G** opted
[blank line]
0 1
[coordinate optimized at B3LYP/6-311++G** level]
[blank line]
450nm 1030nm

In this input file, polar=DCSHG requests Gaussian to calculate hyperpolarizability of SHG type,
namely (-2;,). Two frequencies of incident light are loaded from the end of input file, as
requested by CPHF=rdfreq keyword. Note that #P must be employed, otherwise Multiwfn will be
unable to parse (hyper)polarizability from the output file.

944

--- page break ---

4 Tutorials and Examples
Now we use Multiwfn to parse the output file and export  as .txt file. Boot up Multiwfn and
input below commands
examples\polar\CH3NHCHO\polar.out
24 // (Hyper)polarizability analysis
1 // Parse "polar" task of Gaussian. PS: If you are not familiar with this function, please check
Section 3.27.1 for introduction and 4.24.1 for example
-1 // Request Multiwfn to parse dynamic (hyper)polarizability
-4 // Request Multiwfn to export parsed (hyper)polarizability as .txt file
1 // Start parsing (hyper)polarizability
2 // As shown on screen, the second option corresponds to 1030 nm case
2 // Load SHG form of 
n // Do not perform analysis related to hyper-Rayleigh scattering
Now polarizability tensor () and SHG form of  corresponding to 1030 nm have been
exported to alpha.txt and beta.txt in current folder, respectively.
As mentioned in Section 3.27.5, to realize unit sphere representation, generally you should let
Multiwfn load a file containing atom coordinate, so that Multiwfn can determine proper radius of
the sphere. Here we let Multiwfn directly load atom coordinate from Gaussian output file. To do so,
we change "iloadGaugeom" in settings.ini to 2, that means requesting Multiwfn to load atom
coordinate in standard orientation from the loaded Gaussian output file. Then boot up Multiwfn and
input
examples\polar\CH3NHCHO\polar.out
24 // (Hyper)polarizability analysis
5 // Visualize (hyper)polarizability via unit sphere and vector representations
Now you can find many options used to adjust plotting parameters, such as radius and length
of the arrows on sphere, number of arrows and so on, currently we use default setting. We select
option 2, from prompt on screen you can find Multiwfn automatically loads  tensor from beta.txt
in current folder because it exists, and then export beta.tcl in current folder, which corresponds to
VMD plotting script of unit sphere representation. You can also find beta_vec.tcl has been exported
in current folder, which is VMD plotting script of vector representation.
Since we also want to display molecular structure in VMD, we need to generate a file
containing atom information that can be recognized by VMD, therefore we input
0 // Exit current function
0 // Return to main menu
100 // Other function (Part 1)
2 // Generate new file
1 // Export current geometry as .pdb file
CH3NHCHO.pdb
Now we have CH3NHCHO.pdb in current folder, and we can close Multiwfn program.
Moving the beta.tcl and beta_vec.tcl from current folder to VMD installation folder, then boot
up VMD and input source beta.tcl and source beta_vec.tcl in VMD console window to run these
two plotting scripts in turn. Next, drag CH3NHCHO.pdb to "VMD Main" window to load it, then

4 Tutorials and Examples
enter "Graphics" - "Representation" and change "Drawing Method" to "CPK". Now you can see
below figure in VMD graphical window, two side views are given:

You can find this map is almost exactly identical to Fig. 2(e) in J. Comput. Chem., 32, 1128 (2011),
the marginal differences come from numerical aspects and the fact that definition of B3LYP in
Gaussian is slightly different to that in GAMESS-US. In this map, the arrows on sphere correspond
to scaled eff vectors, the arrow direction is in line with eff, and the length equals to norm of eff
multiplied by scale factor. The arrows are colored according to its length, the shortest (longest)
arrow is colored as blue and red, respectively, the white arrows have medium length. The starting
points of the arrows are evenly distributed on a sphere surface, the sphere radius can be controlled
by corresponding option in Multiwfn.
What can we learn from above maps? In order to elucidate this point, three featured zones are
labelled. The pink arrows are normal vectors at corresponding point of the sphere surface.

• Region 1: If two external electric fields are applied to the molecule along the direction
indicated by the pink arrow, their combination effect will result in occurrence of induced dipole
moment in the same direction, as exhibited by the small arrows on the sphere.
• Region 2: Similar to region 1, but the induced dipole moment occurs in the inverted direction
as applied electric field.
• Region 3: If two external electric fields are applied from top to bottom, as illustrated by the

946

4 Tutorials and Examples
pink arrow, their combination effect will lead to induced dipole moment pointing to the right. This
seemingly weird phenomenon reflects anisotropic response character of this molecule. Clearly,
without employing the unit sphere representation method, this point can hardly be noticed.
Since the  in the present example is SHG type corresponding to 1030 nm, the external electric
fields mentioned above in fact vary with frequency of 1030 nm, they source from 1030 nm light
radiating in the direction perpendicular to them.
The large green arrow in above map is referred to as vector representation, it corresponds to
scaled (x, y, z) vector and exhibits primary character of the . It can be seen that its direction is
basically identical to the vector sum of all arrows on the sphere. Undoubtedly, this vector
representation is concise and useful in representing , however, anisotropy character of  is fully
ignored.

4.24.5.2

Polarizability

and

second-order

hyperpolarizability

of

cyclo[18]carbon
The cyclo[18]carbon is an intriguing system having unusual electronic structure, its various
characteristics, including (hyper)polarizability, have been very comprehensively explored in my
works (see http://sobereva.com/carbon_ring.html for summary). In this section, we employ unit
sphere representation to visually investigate its polarizability and second-order hyperpolarizability
(), this example in fact is a partial reproduction of my research article Chem. Asian J. (2021) DOI:
10.1002/asia.202100589.
The Gaussian input file for calculating (hyper)polarizability, including , has been provided as
examples\polar\C18\gamma.gjf, which utilizes LPol-ds basis set, the basis set file can be obtained
from http://sobereva.com/345. In this example, we only study static  and , therefore 0.0 is
specified after molecular coordinate as frequency of incident light. The geometry has been
optimized at B97XD/def2-TZVP level.
We first extract  and  from Gaussian output file and write it as .txt file. Boot up Multiwfn
and input below commands
examples\polar\C18\gamma.out // Output file of aforementioned input file
24 // (Hyper)polarizability analysis
1 // Parse "polar" task of Gaussian
-4 // Request Multiwfn to export parsed (hyper)polarizability as .txt file
7 // Start parsing  and 
Now we have alpha.txt and gamma.txt in current folder. Then we input
0 // Exit current function
5 // Visualize (hyper)polarizability via unit sphere and vector representations
-3 // Change scale factor of length of the arrows on sphere surface
0.005 // This value is smaller than default, since  of cyclo[18]carbon is fairly large. If default
value is used, you will find the arrows are too long
-5 // Change length scale factor for the arrow of vector representation
0.01
1 // Perform unit sphere representation analysis of . Since alpha.txt already exists in current
folder,  tensor is automatically loaded from it
Now we have alpha.tcl and alpha_vec.tcl file in current folder, which are the VMD plotting

947

4 Tutorials and Examples
scripts of unit sphere representation of  and that of vector representation of . Move them to VMD
folder, boot up VMD, input source alpha.tcl and then source alpha_vec.tcl in turn in VMD console
window to run them.
In order to show molecule structure, again we need to export current molecule structure by
Multiwfn as .pdb file, the steps have been described in the last section. After loading it into VMD
and making its drawing method as CPK, we will see

The arrows on the sphere in this figure reflect magnitude and direction of induced dipole
moment when an external electric field of the same strength is applied to different directions from
the center of the molecule. It can be clearly seen from the figure that the polarizability of the
cyclo[18]carbon ring in the direction parallel (perpendicular) to the ring plane is large (small). This
observation is easy to understand, as indicated in my cyclo[18]carbon research paper Carbon, 165,
468 (2020), this system has 36 highly delocalized electrons (18 in-plane and 18 out-of-plane ones),
therefore when electric field is applied parallelly to the ring, these electrons will be significantly
polarized, resulting in large induced dipole moment; in contrast, the electrons in this system is not
so easily be polarized in the direction perpendicular to the ring. Note that in my cyclo[18]carbon
paper Carbon, 165, 461 (2020), the value of the  components parallel to and perpendicular to the
ring are reported to be 392 and 98 a.u., respectively, evidently the figure shown above is fully in
line with these quantitative values.
The three large double-sided arrows at the center of the above figure exhibit relative magnitude
of  along X, Y, and Z directions, the way of calculating their lengths (x, y, z) has been mentioned
in Section 3.27.5. From the arrow lengths it is very clear that  has much lower magnitude in the
direction perpendicular to the ring compared to other directions.
Similarly, we use unit sphere representation to visually study . In the Multiwfn window we
input
-3 // Change scale factor of length of the arrows on sphere
1E-5 // This value is significantly smaller than default one, since magnitude of  is quite large
-5 // Change length scale factor for the arrow of vector representation
